# Economy Lab – Understanding War Thunder's Economy

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of War Thunder's economy system, focusing on Silver Lions (SL), Research Points (RP), grinding strategies, and economic optimization. Rather than listing specific repair costs or exact earnings that change with patches, this manual explains economic principles and strategies that remain constant.

---

## 1. Economy Fundamentals

### Silver Lions (SL)

**What Are Silver Lions?**
SL is War Thunder's primary currency, used for purchasing vehicles, repairs, crew training, ammunition, and modifications.

**Earning Silver Lions**:
- Battle performance (kills, assists, caps, etc.)
- Time alive and active
- Vehicle tier and modifications
- Premium account bonus
- Premium vehicles bonus

**Spending Silver Lions**:
- Vehicle purchases
- Repair costs (per spawn)
- Crew training and expert/ace qualifications
- Ammunition purchases
- Vehicle modifications

**Critical Concept**: SL can be earned or lost. Managing SL is crucial for sustainable progression.

---

### Research Points (RP)

**What Are Research Points?**
RP is earned through battles and used to research new vehicles and modifications.

**Earning Research Points**:
- Battle performance (kills, assists, caps, etc.)
- Time alive and active
- Vehicle tier and modifications
- Premium account bonus
- Premium vehicles bonus
- Talisman bonuses

**Using Research Points**:
- Researching new vehicles
- Researching vehicle modifications
- Cannot be spent on purchases

**Critical Concept**: RP is separate from SL. You need both to progress.

## 2. Economic Costs

### Repair Costs

**What Are Repair Costs?**
Every vehicle has a repair cost that's deducted when you spawn it, even if you don't die.

**Repair Cost Characteristics**:
- Increases with BR (higher BR = higher cost)
- Varies by vehicle type
- Premium vehicles often have lower costs
- Costs are deducted per spawn

**Economic Impact**:
- High repair costs can drain SL quickly
- Dying early with high repair costs = SL loss
- Low repair costs allow more aggressive play
- Understanding costs prevents bankruptcy

**How to Manage**:
- Check repair costs before spading vehicles
- Consider costs when choosing BR ranges
- Play carefully at high-tier (high costs)
- Use lower repair cost vehicles to recover SL

---

### Ammunition Costs

**What Are Ammunition Costs?**
Different shell types cost different amounts. Firing expensive shells can add up.

**Cost Characteristics**:
- Basic shells (AP, APHE) are cheaper
- Advanced shells (APDS, APFSDS, HEAT-FS) are expensive
- Firing many expensive shells = significant cost
- Shell costs vary by tier and type

**Economic Impact**:
- Firing 50+ expensive shells per match adds up
- Shell choice affects profitability
- Sometimes cheaper shells are more economical

**How to Manage**:
- Use appropriate shells for situation
- Don't waste expensive shells
- Mix shell types based on targets
- Consider economy when choosing shells

---

### Crew Training

**What Is Crew Training?**
Training crews improves performance but costs SL.

**Training Costs**:
- Basic crew training (required to use vehicle)
- Expert qualification (significant improvement)
- Ace qualification (maximum improvement)
- Costs increase with tier and vehicle

**Economic Impact**:
- Well-trained crews significantly improve performance
- Crew training costs can be substantial
- Important to prioritize which crews to train

**How to Manage**:
- Train crews for main lineup first
- Expert qualification is often worth it
- Ace qualification is expensive, consider carefully
- Focus training on important skills

## 3. Why Full Lineups Are More Efficient

### Economic Efficiency

**Single Vehicle Spawns**:
- Limited spawn options
- Die once = match over
- Less time to earn RP/SL
- Less battle activity

**Full Lineup Spawns**:
- Multiple spawn options
- Die once = respawn possible
- More time to earn RP/SL
- Higher battle activity

**Economic Impact**:
- Full lineups = more opportunities to earn
- More spawns = more potential income
- Better battle activity = better rewards
- Economic safety from multiple spawns

---

### Battle Activity

**What Is Battle Activity?**
Time alive and active in battle affects RP/SL earnings.

**How Lineups Help**:
- Multiple spawns = more time active
- Longer matches = better rewards
- More actions = more activity
- Better activity = better earnings

**Economic Benefit**:
- Full lineups increase battle activity
- More activity = better RP/SL per match
- Economic efficiency from multiple spawns

---

## 4. Premium Time and Premium Vehicles

### Premium Time

**What Is Premium Time?**
Premium account status doubles RP and SL earnings.

**When It Makes Sense**:
- If you play regularly
- When you want faster progression
- When you have disposable income
- If you enjoy the game long-term

**Economic Consideration**:
- Cost: ~$10-15 per month
- Value: High if you play regularly
- Effect: Doubles earnings

**Conservative Advice**:
- Wait until you know you'll play regularly
- Don't buy if unsure about commitment
- Consider time-limited deals
- Not required for progression

---

### Premium Vehicles

**What Are Premium Vehicles?**
Vehicles that earn more RP/SL than tech tree equivalents.

**When They Make Sense**:
- After understanding what you want
- When you enjoy a specific vehicle
- When they fit your playstyle
- When they help grind specific tech trees

**Economic Consideration**:
- Cost: $10-60+ depending on vehicle
- Value: Varies by vehicle and usage
- Effect: Increased RP/SL earnings

**Conservative Advice**:
- Wait until you know what you want
- Research before buying
- Don't buy high-tier premiums without mid-tier experience
- Consider if vehicle fits your playstyle

---

### Talismans

**What Are Talismans?**
Items that double RP earnings on a specific vehicle.

**When They Make Sense**:
- When you love a specific vehicle
- When vehicle fits your playstyle
- When you'll use vehicle long-term
- When vehicle is effective for you

**Economic Consideration**:
- Cost: Golden Eagles (varies by tier)
- Value: Good if you use vehicle frequently
- Effect: Doubles RP on that vehicle only

**Conservative Advice**:
- Only buy for vehicles you'll use long-term
- Consider if vehicle is effective for you
- Not worth it if you won't use vehicle often

## 8. Case Study: Two Approaches to Economy

Understanding economic principles is easier with concrete examples. Here's a comparison of two different approaches:

### Player A: The Top-Tier Rushed

**Approach**: Rushed to top tier with one MBT, plays top-tier exclusively.

**Lineup**: Single top-tier MBT, no backup vehicles, no SPAA, no CAS.

**Economic Results**:
- Dies early in most matches (limited experience at top tier)
- Loses SL on most matches (high repair costs, low battle activity)
- Can't afford to repair vehicle consistently
- Forced to play lower tiers to recover SL
- Slow progression due to poor performance

**Why It Fails**: 
- No backup vehicles = low battle activity
- High repair costs + poor performance = SL loss
- Single vehicle = limited spawn options
- Rushed progression = lack of fundamentals

### Player B: The Mid-Tier Specialist

**Approach**: Masters mid-tier (5.7-6.7), builds strong lineups, focuses on fundamentals.

**Lineup**: Multiple vehicles at same BR, includes MBT, light tank, SPAA, and CAS options.

**Economic Results**:
- Consistent performance (mastered BR range)
- Profits on most matches (reasonable repair costs, good battle activity)
- Can afford repairs and crew training
- Sustainable progression
- Strong fundamentals transfer to higher tiers

**Why It Succeeds**:
- Full lineup = high battle activity
- Reasonable costs + good performance = SL profit
- Multiple vehicles = flexible spawn options
- Mastered fundamentals = better performance

> **Economy Insight:** Player B's approach is sustainable and effective. They build strong fundamentals while maintaining a healthy economy. When they advance to higher tiers, they do so with experience and economic stability.

### The Budget Grinding Framework

Use this step-by-step framework to optimize your economy:

**Step 1: Assess Your Current Situation**
- What BR range are you playing?
- Are you profiting or losing SL?
- What's your average battle activity?
- Do you have full lineups?

**Step 2: Identify Problems**
- Are repair costs too high for your performance?
- Are you dying too early?
- Do you lack backup vehicles?
- Are you playing above your skill level?

**Step 3: Adjust BR Range**
- If losing SL, drop to lower BR
- Find BR where you can consistently profit
- Master that BR before advancing

**Step 4: Build Complete Lineups**
- Add backup vehicles at same BR
- Include SPAA for air defense
- Consider CAS options
- Keep BR spread tight (within 0.7 BR)

**Step 5: Focus on Survival**
- Improve positioning
- Use cover effectively
- Don't take unnecessary risks
- Retreat when outmatched

**Step 6: Monitor and Adjust**
- Track your SL balance
- Adjust BR if needed
- Build lineups gradually
- Focus on fundamentals

> **Pro Tip:** This framework works at any BR. Apply it consistently, and you'll maintain a healthy economy while improving your skills.

## 9. Economic Safety Guidelines
