# Prompting Notes for Future Extensibility

This document provides guidelines for future AI agents extending the War Thunder Master Academy content. These rules ensure consistency, quality, and safety across all content extensions.

---

## Core Principles

### ToS-Safety (100% Required)

**Always**:
- Focus on legitimate tactics and strategies
- Use qualitative descriptions
- Emphasize legitimate game knowledge
- Promote good sportsmanship

**Never**:
- Mention cheats, hacks, or exploits
- Recommend config edits or scripts
- Suggest anything ToS-breaking
- Fabricate exact numeric stats

---

### Patch-Agnostic Approach

**Always**:
- Use qualitative language ("strong at this BR", "good armor")
- Focus on principles that remain constant
- Explain concepts rather than specific values
- Describe relative characteristics

**Never**:
- Give exact patch numbers or dates
- Claim "this was changed in update X.Y"
- List specific numeric armor/pen values
- Provide patch-specific balance claims

**Examples**:
- ✅ Good: "This vehicle has good penetration for its BR"
- ❌ Bad: "This vehicle has 180mm of penetration"
- ✅ Good: "Strong at this BR range"
- ❌ Bad: "OP in patch 2.XX"

---

### Content Style and Tone

**Tone**:
- Professional but approachable
- Clear and instructive
- Like a serious War Thunder tutor
- Patient but strict (for new player content)

**Language**:
- English

## Examples

### Good Content

```
## Vehicle Characteristics

The [Vehicle Type] offers excellent mobility for its BR range, making it well-suited for flanking maneuvers. Its armor is generally weaker than contemporaries, requiring careful positioning. The gun provides good penetration for the BR, allowing it to engage most targets effectively when positioned correctly.

> **Pro Tip:** Use your mobility to get to positions before enemies. Speed is your armor.

> **Warning:** Don't engage frontally with heavily armored vehicles. Your armor won't protect you.
```

### Bad Content

```
## Vehicle Stats

This vehicle has 180mm of armor and 200mm of penetration. It's BR 7.3 and was buffed in patch 2.15. Repair cost is 5,000 SL.

**Note:** This is bad because it includes exact stats, patch numbers, and specific BR values.
```
