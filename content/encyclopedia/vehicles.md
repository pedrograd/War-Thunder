## 2. Key Characteristics to Evaluate

When evaluating vehicles, consider these characteristics and how they interact.

### Mobility

**What It Means**: How fast and agile a vehicle is.

**Aspects**:
- Top speed
- Acceleration
- Reverse speed
- Turning ability
- Terrain handling

**Why It Matters**: Mobility determines how you can position and reposition. High mobility = more options.

**How to Evaluate**: Consider if mobility matches your playstyle. Fast players need fast vehicles. Defensive players can use slower vehicles.

> **Pro Tip:** Mobility is often more important than armor. Fast vehicles can avoid threats that slow vehicles must face.

### Armor

**What It Means**: How well a vehicle can resist incoming fire.

**Aspects**:
- Armor thickness
- Armor layout
- Weakspots
- Angling effectiveness
- Composite/ERA protection

**Why It Matters**: Armor determines how much punishment you can take. Good armor = more survivability.

**How to Evaluate**: Consider if armor matches your playstyle. Aggressive players need armor. Mobile players can rely less on armor.

> **Warning:** Don't rely solely on armor. Good positioning beats good armor. Use armor as a tool, not a crutch.

### Firepower

**What It Means**: How effective a vehicle's weapons are.

**Aspects**:
- Gun penetration
- Post-penetration damage
- Reload speed
- Gun depression/elevation
- Ammunition selection

**Why It Matters**: Firepower determines how effectively you can eliminate enemies. Good firepower = faster kills.

**How to Evaluate**: Consider if firepower matches your targets. High-penetration guns for heavy armor. High-damage guns for light armor.

> **Meta Insight:** Firepower is important, but shot placement matters more. A well-placed shot with moderate firepower beats a poorly-placed shot with high firepower.

### Technology

**What It Means**: Advanced systems that provide advantages.

**Aspects**:
- Stabilizers
- Thermal imaging
- Laser rangefinders
- Active protection systems
- Advanced fire control

**Why It Matters**: Technology provides significant advantages. Advanced systems = better performance.

**How to Evaluate**: Consider if technology matches your needs. Some players need thermals. Others can do without.

> **Technical Insight:** Technology is a force multiplier. It doesn't replace skill, but it amplifies it.

## 3. Evaluating Vehicles for Your Playstyle

Not every vehicle suits every player. Learn to evaluate vehicles for your specific playstyle.

### For Aggressive Players

**Look For**:
- High mobility
- Good firepower
- Stabilizers (if available)
- Fast reload
- Good reverse speed

**Avoid**:
- Very slow vehicles
- Vehicles with poor reverse
- Vehicles that require careful positioning

- Good armor
- Powerful guns
- Hull-down capability
- Good gun depression
- Long-range effectiveness

**Avoid**:
- Very fragile vehicles
- Vehicles that require aggressive play
- Vehicles with poor armor
- Close-range specialists

> **Meta Insight:** Defensive players need vehicles that can hold positions effectively. Armor and firepower are key.

### For Flanking Players

**Look For**:
- High mobility
- Good firepower
- Scouting ability
- Low profile
- Good reverse speed

**Avoid**:
- Slow vehicles
- Large profile vehicles

## 4. Building Effective Lineups

A good lineup has synergy. Vehicles should complement each other.

### Lineup Composition Principles

**Diversity**: Include different vehicle types to handle different situations.

**BR Consistency**: Keep vehicles within 0.3-0.7 BR of each other for consistent matchmaking.

**Role Coverage**: Cover different roles (brawler, flanker, sniper, SPAA, CAS).

**Economic Balance**: Consider repair costs. Don't bring only expensive vehicles.

> **Meta Insight:** A balanced lineup gives you options. Don't bring only one vehicle type.

### Example Lineup Structures

**Balanced Lineup**:
- 2-3 Main fighting vehicles (mediums or heavies)
- 1 Light tank or scout
- 1 SPAA
- 1 CAS aircraft (optional)

**Aggressive Lineup**:
- 2-3 Fast mediums or lights
- 1 SPAA
- 1 CAS aircraft
- Focus on mobility and speed

**Defensive Lineup**:
- 2-3 Heavies or TDs
- 1 Medium for flexibility
- 1 SPAA
- Focus on armor and firepower

> **Pro Tip:** Build lineups that match your playstyle. Don't copy lineups that don't suit you.

## 5. Vehicle Progression Strategy

Understanding how to progress through vehicle trees helps you build effective lineups.

### Research Order

**Foundation First**: Research vehicles that form the core of your lineup before specialized vehicles.

**Modifications Matter**: Research modifications before moving to next vehicle. Spaded vehicles perform significantly better.

**Lineup Building**: Research vehicles that work together. Don't research random vehicles.

**Economic Consideration**: Consider repair costs. Some vehicles are expensive to use.

> **Warning:** Don't rush through the tech tree. Master vehicles before advancing. Spaded vehicles are much more effective.

### When to Stop and Master

**Signs You Should Stop**:
- Consistently losing SL
- Not performing well
- Not understanding vehicles
- Rushing through without learning

**Benefits of Mastering**:
- Better performance
- Better economy
- Better understanding
- More enjoyment

> **Meta Insight:** Mastery beats progression speed. A player who masters 5.7 BR is better than a player who rushes to 11.0 without learning.

## 6. Common Vehicle Evaluation Mistakes

Avoid these mistakes when evaluating vehicles.

### Overvaluing Raw Stats

**The Mistake**: Thinking higher numbers always mean better vehicles.

**The Reality**: How stats interact matters more than individual stats. A vehicle with moderate stats that work well together can beat a vehicle with high stats that don't synergize.

**Solution**: Evaluate vehicles holistically. Consider how characteristics work together.

### Ignoring Playstyle Fit

**The Mistake**: Choosing vehicles that don't match your playstyle.

**The Reality**: A vehicle that's strong but doesn't fit your playstyle will underperform for you.

**Solution**: Choose vehicles that match how you play. Don't force yourself into playstyles you don't enjoy.

### Not Considering Lineup Synergy

**The Mistake**: Choosing vehicles in isolation without considering lineup.

**The Reality**: Vehicles work better in good lineups. A strong vehicle in a bad lineup is less effective.

**Solution**: Build lineups with synergy. Consider how vehicles complement each other.

### Rushing to High Tiers

**The Mistake**: Advancing too quickly without mastering lower tiers.

**The Reality**: High-tier vehicles require skills learned at lower tiers. Rushing leads to poor performance.

**Solution**: Master each BR range before advancing. Build skills progressively.

> **Warning:** Rushing to high tiers is a common mistake. Take your time and learn fundamentals.
