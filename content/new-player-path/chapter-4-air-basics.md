# Chapter 4: Air Forces Basics

While this path focuses on ground forces, understanding air combat basics will help you understand the full War Thunder experience and defend against aircraft.

## Why Learn Air Forces?

**Even as a ground player, you should know**:
- How aircraft attack ground targets
- How to defend against aircraft
- How to use SPAA effectively
- What to expect from friendly aircraft

**If you want to play air forces**:
- This chapter gives you the basics
- Complete the Air Academy module for full training
- Air combat is complex but rewarding

## Basic Aircraft Controls

### Flight Controls

**Pitch (Nose Up/Down)**:
- **W**: Pitch up (climb)
- **S**: Pitch down (dive)
- Controls your altitude

**Roll (Bank Left/Right)**:
- **A**: Roll left
- **D**: Roll right
- Tilts your aircraft

**Yaw (Turn Left/Right)**:
- **Q**: Yaw left
- **E**: Yaw right
- Minor directional control

**Throttle**:
- **Shift**: Increase throttle
- **Ctrl**: Decrease throttle
- Controls speed

### Combat Controls

**Fire Weapons**:
- **Space**: Fire machine guns/cannons
- **R**: Fire rockets
- **B**: Drop bombs

**View Controls**:
- **C**: Free look (look around)
- **V**: Change view (cockpit, third person, etc.)
- **Mouse**: Look around in cockpit view

## Basic Flight Mechanics

### Energy

**Energy = Speed + Altitude**

**High Energy**:
- Fast speed and/or high altitude
- Can convert to speed or altitude
- Advantage in combat

**Low Energy**:
- Slow speed and low altitude
- Limited options
- Disadvantage in combat

**Key Concept**: Energy is everything in air combat. Always try to maintain energy advantage.

### Speed vs. Altitude

**Speed**:
- Fast = harder to hit
- Fast = can escape
- Fast = can catch enemies

**Altitude**:
- High = can dive for speed
- High = can see more
- High = energy advantage

**Best Strategy**: Start high, use altitude to gain speed when needed

## Basic Combat Concepts

### Boom and Zoom (BnZ)

**What it is**: Dive on enemy, shoot, then climb away

**How to do it**:
1. Start above enemy (altitude advantage)
2. Dive down on enemy
3. Shoot while diving
4. Use speed to climb back up
5. Repeat

**Best for**: Fast aircraft with good climb rate

### Turn Fighting

**What it is**: Turning in circles to get behind enemy

**How to do it**:
1. Turn to face enemy
2. Keep turning to get behind
3. Shoot when you have angle
4. Out-turn enemy

**Best for**: Maneuverable aircraft

### Energy Fighting

**What it is**: Using energy advantage to control engagement

**Key Principles**:
- Maintain energy advantage
- Don't waste energy
- Convert altitude to speed when needed
- Climb when safe

## Aircraft Types

### Fighters

**Role**: Air-to-air combat

**Characteristics**:
- Fast and maneuverable
- Good weapons
- Best for: Learning air combat

**Recommended for beginners**: ✅ Yes - Best way to learn

### Bombers

**Role**: Bomb ground targets

**Characteristics**:
- Heavy, slow
- Powerful bombs
- Defensive guns
- Best for: Ground attack missions

**Not recommended for beginners**: ❌ Too slow, easy target

### Attackers

**Role**: Attack ground targets with guns/rockets

**Characteristics**:
- Armored
- Good ground attack weapons
- Can defend against fighters
- Best for: Ground RB support

**Moderate difficulty**: ⚠️ Can be effective but requires skill

## Basic Tactics

### Climb at Start

**Why**: Altitude = energy = advantage

**How**:
1. At match start, climb to 3000-5000m
2. Don't rush to enemy spawn
3. Gain altitude advantage
4. Then engage enemies

### Don't Turn Fight Everything

**Why**: Some aircraft turn better than others

**What to do**:
- If enemy turns better: Use BnZ instead
- If you turn better: Turn fight
- Know your aircraft's strengths

### Watch Your Six

**Why**: Enemies will try to get behind you

**What to do**:
- Check behind you frequently (C key)
- Use free look to scan
- Don't tunnel vision on one target
- Be aware of all threats

### Energy Management

**Key Rules**:
- Don't waste energy in unnecessary maneuvers
- Climb when safe
- Use altitude to gain speed
- Don't dive too low (lose altitude advantage)

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Climbing

**What happens**: You're low and slow, easy target

**How to avoid**: Always climb at match start

### Mistake 2: Turn Fighting Everything

**What happens**: You lose energy, become easy target

**How to avoid**: Use BnZ when appropriate

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Enemies Behind

**What happens**: You get shot down from behind

**How to avoid**: Check behind you frequently

### Mistake 4: Wasting Energy

**What happens**: You become slow and vulnerable

**How to avoid**: Manage energy carefully, don't waste it

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Flight

1. Start in Arcade Air mode
2. Practice basic controls (pitch, roll, yaw)
3. Practice climbing and diving
4. Get comfortable with controls

**Goal**: Comfortable with basic flight

### Exercise 2: Energy Management

1. Climb to high altitude
2. Practice diving and climbing
3. Maintain energy
4. Don't waste energy

**Goal**: Understand energy concepts

### Exercise 3: Basic Combat

1. Find an enemy
2. Try to get behind them
3. Practice aiming and shooting
4. Learn when to break off

**Goal**: Basic combat experience

## Ground Forces Connection

### How Aircraft Attack Ground Targets

**Dive Bombing**:
- Aircraft dives on target
- Drops bomb
- Pulls up and away

**Strafing**:
- Aircraft flies low
- Uses guns/rockets
- Attacks ground vehicles

**How to Defend**:
- Use SPAA (anti-air vehicles)
- Hide in cover
- Move unpredictably
- Use smoke if available

### Using SPAA

**When to use**: Enemy aircraft are attacking

**How to use**:
- Lead your shots (aim ahead of aircraft)
- Use tracer rounds to see trajectory
- Shoot in bursts, not continuous
- Aim for center of aircraft

## What's Next?

You now understand the basics of both ground and air forces! In **Chapter 5: Your First Matches**, we'll guide you through what to expect in your first real battles and how to apply what you've learned.
