# New Player Path – 0 to 200 Battles

This guide provides a structured training program designed to take you from your first battle to your 200th, establishing solid fundamentals while avoiding the common pitfalls that cause new players to quit, go broke, or develop bad habits that limit long-term growth.

**This is not a speedrun guide.** This is a foundation-building program. Players who rush to high-tier vehicles without mastering fundamentals consistently perform worse, lose more Silver Lions, and burn out faster than those who invest time in proper training.

## 1. Orientation: What War Thunder Really Is

### Core Concepts

Before diving into tactics, you must understand the fundamental systems that govern War Thunder:

**Battle Rating (BR):** Every vehicle has a Battle Rating that determines matchmaking. BR ranges from 1.0 (reserve vehicles) to 12.0+ (modern vehicles). Matchmaking typically places you in battles with vehicles within ±1.0 BR of your highest vehicle. Understanding BR is critical—bringing a 3.7 vehicle into a 4.7 lineup means you'll face stronger opponents.

**Lineups:** A lineup is your selection of vehicles for a single battle. In Ground Realistic Battles (GRB), you can spawn multiple times if you have enough Spawn Points (SP). A proper lineup contains 3–5 vehicles at the same BR, including tanks, SPAA (Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft), and optionally a CAS (Close Air Support) aircraft.

**Research Points (RP):** RP is earned through battle performance and is used to unlock new vehicles and modifications. RP gain is affected by:
- Battle activity (time alive, actions taken)
- Vehicle tier (higher tiers require more RP)
- Premium account status
- Vehicle modifications (spaded vehicles earn more RP)

**Silver Lions (SL):** SL is the in-game currency used for:
- Purchasing vehicles
- Repairing damaged vehicles
- Training crews
- Purchasing ammunition
- Modifying vehicles

**Crews:** Each vehicle slot has a crew with skills that affect performance. Crew skills include:
- Tank driving/aircraft piloting
- Targeting
- Reload speed
- Vitality (survivability)
- Repair speed

Crew training costs SL and is essential for competitive performance.

**Game Modes:**
- **Arcade Battles (AB):** More forgiving, faster-paced, markers visible
- **Realistic Battles (RB):** No markers, more realistic physics, higher rewards
- **Simulator Battles (SB):** Full realism, cockpit view only, highest rewards

This guide focuses on Ground RB and Air RB, as they offer the best balance of realism and accessibility for new players.

### The Deceptive Beginning

Your first 5–10 battles will be against bots. This creates a false sense of competence. Bot behavior is predictable, their aim is poor, and they rarely use advanced tactics. Real players will punish mistakes immediately.

**The Tier Trap:** Many new players rush to unlock high-tier vehicles (8.0+ BR), believing that better vehicles will make them better players. This is false. High-tier gameplay is faster, more punishing, and requires deeper knowledge. Players who skip fundamentals struggle at every tier.

**The Economy Reality:** War Thunder's economy is designed to encourage spending, but it's possible to progress without spending money if you understand the systems. Players who ignore economy fundamentals often find themselves unable to afford repairs, forcing them to either spend money or play lower-tier vehicles to recover.

> **Warning:** Do not rush to high tier. Players who reach top tier without proper training typically have negative K/D ratios, negative SL income, and quit within weeks.

## 2. Core Principles for New Players

### Priority Hierarchy

In early battles, your priorities should be:

1. **Survival** > Kills > Caps
   - Staying alive longer means more time to learn, more actions taken, more RP/SL earned
   - Dead players learn nothing
   - A player who survives 8 minutes with 1 kill earns more than a player who dies in 2 minutes with 2 kills

2. **Economic Safety** > Progression Speed
   - Never let your SL balance drop below 100,000
   - If you're losing SL consistently, drop to a lower BR
   - Repair costs increase dramatically at higher tiers

3. **Fundamentals** > Vehicle Unlocks
   - Understanding weakspots, map positioning, and situational awareness matters more than having the latest vehicle
   - A skilled player in a 3.7 vehicle will outperform an unskilled player in a 5.7 vehicle

### Nation Selection

**Focus on 1–2 nations initially.** Spreading yourself across all nations dilutes your learning and SL reserves. Each nation has different characteristics:

- **USA:** Good gun depression, versatile vehicles, strong CAS
- **Germany:** Excellent guns, good armor at mid-tier, strong heavy tanks
- **USSR:** Good armor, powerful guns, forgiving for beginners
- **UK:** High-penetration solid shot, requires precision aiming
- **Japan:** Light, fast vehicles, requires finesse
- **France:** Unique playstyle, better at mid-to-high tier
- **Italy:** Fast vehicles, good flankers
- **Sweden:** High-penetration guns, unique vehicles
- **China:** Mix of USSR and USA vehicles

**Recommendation:** Start with USA, Germany, or USSR. These nations have forgiving early vehicles and teach different playstyles.

### Building Proper Lineups

A proper lineup contains:

1. **2–3 Main Battle Tanks:** Mix of medium/heavy tanks at the same BR
2. **1 SPAA:** Essential for countering enemy aircraft
3. **1 CAS Aircraft (optional but recommended):** Provides air support after ground spawns are exhausted

**Lineup BR Consistency:** All vehicles should be within 0.3 BR of each other. Never bring a 2.0 vehicle into a 3.7 lineup—you'll be ineffective.

### Critical Settings Changes

Before your first real battle, adjust these settings:

**Economy Settings:**
- **Turn off Auto-Repair:** Repair costs are lower if you wait between sessions
- **Turn off Auto-Purchase:** Manually purchase vehicles to control spending
- **Turn off Auto-Crew Training:** Manually train crews to prioritize important skills

**Gameplay Settings:**
- **Disable "Join Already Active Battles":** Starting mid-battle puts you at a disadvantage
- **Enable "Auto-Repair Crew":** Keep this on for convenience
- **Set "Auto-Select Best Crew":** Helps ensure you use your best crews

**Camera Settings:**
- **Increase Camera Distance:** Better situational awareness
- **Enable "Camera from Tank Gunner Sight":** More accurate aiming
- **Adjust Camera Sensitivity:** Find a comfortable setting for looking around

**Audio Settings:**
- **Increase Engine Sound Volume:** Hearing enemy vehicles is critical
- **Enable "Hear Your Own Engine":** Helps with immersion and awareness
- **Adjust Aircraft Sound:** Learn to identify aircraft by engine sound

**Keybinds:**
- **Binoculars:** Bind to a key (default B). Essential for scouting
- **Machine Gun:** Bind separately from main gun
- **Smoke:** Bind for tactical use
- **Range Finder:** Bind if available on your vehicle

> **Pro Tip:** Spend 10 minutes in the settings menu before your first battle. Proper configuration prevents frustration and improves performance.

## 3. Phase I — Battles 0 to 10: Bot Purgatory

### Understanding Bot Matches

Your first 5–10 battles will be against AI-controlled bots. These matches are designed to ease you into the game, but they create dangerous misconceptions:

- **Bots are predictable:** They follow simple paths and rarely flank
- **Bots have poor aim:** They miss shots that real players would hit
- **Bots don't use advanced tactics:** No hull-down positioning, no crossfire, no coordinated pushes

**The Deception:** Players who perform well against bots often assume they're ready for real players. They're not. Real players will punish every mistake.

### What to Actually Practice

Use bot matches to build mechanical skills, not tactical knowledge:

**Basic Camera Control:**
- Practice looking around while moving
- Use third-person and gunner sight views
- Learn to quickly switch between views
- Practice using binoculars to scout

**Aiming Fundamentals:**
- Learn to identify weakspots on common vehicles:
  - **Turret ring:** Weak point between turret and hull
  - **Driver port:** Vision port on front hull
  - **Lower front plate:** Thinner armor below main armor
  - **Machine gun port:** Small weakspot on front hull
  - **Side armor:** Always thinner than front armor
- Practice leading moving targets
- Learn to estimate range (use rangefinder when available)

**Movement Basics:**
- WASD movement and turning
- Peeking from cover (expose only your turret)
- Reversing into cover after firing
- Using terrain to hide your hull

**Simple Daily Drills:**

1. **Weakspot Practice (10 minutes daily):**
   - Enter Test Drive mode
   - Select a common enemy vehicle as target
   - Fire 10 shots at weakspots from different angles
   - Repeat with different vehicles

2. **Movement Drill (5 minutes daily):**
   - In Test Drive, practice: Move → Stop → Aim → Fire → Reverse
   - Repeat until it becomes muscle memory
   - Practice on different terrain (hills, urban areas, open fields)

3. **Situational Awareness (ongoing):**
   - In bot matches, consciously check your minimap every 5 seconds
   - Identify where teammates are
   - Identify where enemies are (if spotted)
   - Practice predicting enemy positions

### Bad Habits vs. Good Habits

| Bad Habit | Good Replacement Habit |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Rushing straight to capture points | Move cautiously, use cover, check angles |
| Firing immediately upon seeing an enemy | Take time to aim at weakspots |
| Standing still in the open | Always be near cover, keep moving between shots |
| Ignoring the minimap | Check minimap every 5 seconds |
| Using only third-person view | Switch between third-person and gunner sight |
| Repairing in the open | Find cover before repairing |
| Chasing kills | Prioritize survival and positioning |
| Ignoring aircraft | Learn to identify friendly vs. enemy aircraft |
| Not using binoculars | Use binoculars to scout before engaging |
| Rage-quitting after death | Analyze what went wrong, learn from mistakes |

### Transition Warning

After approximately 10 battles, you'll begin facing real players. The difficulty spike is significant. Expect:
- Faster reaction times from enemies
- Better positioning and tactics
- Coordinated team play
- Aircraft that will kill you if you're exposed

**Prepare mentally:** Your performance will drop. This is normal. Focus on learning, not winning.

## 4. Phase II — Battles 10 to 50: Surviving the Economy Wall

### The Economy Reality Check

Between battles 10 and 50, most players hit the "economy wall"—they start losing Silver Lions faster than they earn them. This section explains how to avoid bankruptcy.

### Silver Lions Economy Basics

**Repair Costs:**
- Every vehicle has a repair cost that increases with BR
- Repair costs are deducted when you spawn a vehicle, even if you don't die
- Higher-tier vehicles can cost 5,000–15,000 SL per spawn
- If you die early and contribute little, you'll lose SL

**Ammunition Costs:**
- Different shell types have different costs
- APCR and HEAT shells are expensive
- Firing 50+ shells per match adds up
- Learn which shells are cost-effective for your BR

**Crew Training:**
- Training crews to expert/ace level costs SL
- Crew skills significantly affect performance
- Prioritize: Targeting, Reload Speed, Driving/Piloting, Vitality
- Don't train every crew slot immediately—focus on your main lineup

**Crew Slots:**
- You start with 5 crew slots
- Additional slots cost Golden Eagles (premium currency)
- You don't need more than 5 slots initially
- Focus on making your 5 slots effective

### Why Buying Every Vehicle is Bad

New players often unlock and purchase every vehicle they research. This is a mistake:

- **SL Drain:** Purchasing vehicles you won't use wastes SL
- **Crew Dilution:** Training crews for unused vehicles wastes SL
- **Lineup Confusion:** Too many vehicles at different BRs prevents building proper lineups

**Better Strategy:** Research vehicles, but only purchase those that fit your current lineup. Skip vehicles that don't fit your BR range.

### Picking Your Training BR Range

**Ground Forces:**
- **BR 1.0–2.0:** Too easy, teaches bad habits
- **BR 2.7–3.7:** **Recommended starting range**—good balance of gameplay and economy
- **BR 4.0–5.0:** More challenging, higher repair costs
- **BR 5.3–6.7:** Mid-tier, where fundamentals are most important
- **BR 7.0+:** High-tier, avoid until 100+ battles

**Air Forces:**
- **BR 1.0–2.0:** Good for learning flight mechanics
- **BR 2.7–3.7:** **Recommended for learning**—manageable aircraft, good economy
- **BR 4.0–5.0:** More complex aircraft, higher skill requirement
- **BR 5.3–6.7:** Jet introduction, significant difficulty spike

**Recommendation:** Stay in BR 2.7–3.7 for your first 50 battles. Master this range before moving up.

### Building Your First Real Lineup

**Step 1: Choose Your Nation**
- Pick USA, Germany, or USSR (most forgiving for beginners)
- Research vehicles in that nation only

**Step 2: Identify Your Target BR**
- Aim for BR 2.7 or 3.0 initially
- Research vehicles that cluster around this BR

**Step 3: Build the Lineup**
- **2 Medium/Heavy Tanks:** Your primary spawns
- **1 Light Tank or TD:** For flanking or sniping
- **1 SPAA:** Essential for countering aircraft
- **1 CAS Aircraft (optional):** Learn basic CAS if interested

**Example Generic Lineup (BR 3.0):**
- Medium Tank (BR 3.0)
- Heavy/Medium Tank (BR 3.0)
- Light Tank or Tank Destroyer (BR 2.7–3.0)
- SPAA (BR 2.7–3.0)
- CAS Aircraft (BR 2.7–3.0)

### Safe Grind Rules

Do not advance to a new BR until you meet ALL of these criteria:

1. **Full Lineup:** You have 3–4 vehicles at the new BR
2. **Survival Time:** You consistently survive 3+ minutes per spawn
3. **Weakspot Knowledge:** You know weakspots for common enemies at that BR
4. **Positive SL Income:** You're earning more SL than you're spending
5. **Map Awareness:** You know basic positions on 3+ common maps
6. **Crew Training:** Your crews have at least level 30 in key skills

**If you fail any criterion, stay at your current BR and practice more.**

### Common Mistakes Between Battle 10 and 50

**Mistake 1: Advancing BR Too Quickly**
- **Symptom:** Constantly facing vehicles you can't penetrate
- **Solution:** Drop to a lower BR, learn weakspots, build a proper lineup

**Mistake 2: Ignoring SPAA**
- **Symptom:** Dying repeatedly to aircraft
- **Solution:** Always include SPAA in your lineup, learn to use it

**Mistake 3: Not Using Cover**
- **Symptom:** Dying within 30 seconds of spawning
- **Solution:** Always move from cover to cover, never cross open ground

**Mistake 4: Chasing Kills**
- **Symptom:** Dying while trying to secure a kill
- **Solution:** Survival > kills. Let teammates finish off damaged enemies if you're at risk

**Mistake 5: Not Checking Minimap**
- **Symptom:** Getting flanked constantly
- **Solution:** Check minimap every 5 seconds, learn to read it

**Mistake 6: Repairing in the Open**
- **Symptom:** Dying while repairing
- **Solution:** Always find cover before repairing, use smoke if available

**Mistake 7: Ignoring Aircraft**
- **Symptom:** Dying to CAS repeatedly
- **Solution:** Learn aircraft identification, use SPAA, avoid open areas when aircraft are present

**Mistake 8: Not Learning Maps**
- **Symptom:** Getting lost, not knowing where enemies come from
- **Solution:** Play each map multiple times, learn common routes and positions

**Mistake 9: Using Wrong Ammunition**
- **Symptom:** Bouncing shots off enemies you should penetrate
- **Solution:** Learn which shells to use against which targets, carry multiple shell types

**Mistake 10: Rage Quitting**
- **Symptom:** Quitting after first death, not learning from mistakes
- **Solution:** Stay in battle, observe teammates, learn from deaths

## 5. Phase III — Battles 50 to 100: Entering Real PvP

### The Transition to Human Opponents

By battle 50, you should be facing primarily human players. The gameplay changes significantly:

- **Faster Pace:** Players react quickly and punish mistakes immediately
- **Better Positioning:** Players use cover, hull-down positions, and crossfires
- **Coordination:** Teams work together (sometimes)
- **Aircraft Threat:** CAS becomes a serious threat from skilled pilots

This phase is where fundamentals separate successful players from those who quit.

### Map Knowledge

**Why It Matters:** Knowing maps is more important than having the best vehicle. A skilled player on a familiar map will outperform an unskilled player with a better vehicle.

**What to Learn:**
- **Spawn Points:** Where you and enemies spawn
- **Capture Points:** Location and routes to each cap
- **Common Routes:** Where players typically move
- **Sniping Positions:** Good spots for long-range engagements
- **Flanking Routes:** Paths to get behind enemies
- **Cover Locations:** Where to hide and repair
- **Elevation Changes:** Hills and depressions that provide cover

**How to Learn:**
- Play each map multiple times
- After each death, ask: "Where did that shot come from?"
- Watch where successful teammates position themselves
- Use the minimap to understand map layout
- In Test Drive, explore maps in custom battles (if available)

**Priority Maps to Master (by battle 100):**
- Learn 3–5 common maps thoroughly
- Understand basic positions on 5–7 additional maps
- Don't try to master every map—focus on common ones first

### Minimap Awareness

The minimap is your most important tool after your main gun. Check it every 5 seconds.

**What to Look For:**
- **Teammate Positions:** Where your team is, where gaps exist
- **Enemy Markers:** Spotted enemies (orange/red markers)
- **Capture Point Status:** Which caps are contested
- **Aircraft Icons:** Friendly and enemy aircraft positions
- **Death Markers:** Where teammates died (indicates enemy presence)

**Minimap Reading Skills:**
- **Gap Identification:** See where enemies can flank
- **Overextension Detection:** Recognize when you're too far forward
- **Support Opportunities:** Identify where teammates need help
- **Retreat Timing:** Know when to fall back

**Training Exercise:** Play 5 matches where your ONLY goal is to check the minimap every 5 seconds. Don't worry about kills—focus on awareness.

### Sound Awareness

War Thunder's audio provides critical information. Learn to use it:

**Engine Sounds:**
- **Friendly vs. Enemy:** Friendly engines are quieter, enemy engines are louder
- **Vehicle Type:** Different vehicles have distinct engine sounds
- **Distance Estimation:** Learn to judge distance by engine volume
- **Direction:** Use stereo audio to determine direction

**Track Sounds:**
- **Movement Detection:** Hear enemies moving nearby
- **Direction:** Tracks indicate which way vehicles are moving
- **Speed:** Faster movement = louder track sounds

**Aircraft Sounds:**
- **Engine Type:** Propeller vs. jet engines sound different
- **Approach Warning:** Learn to identify diving aircraft
- **Bomb Drop:** Recognize bomb release sounds

**Gunfire:**
- **Direction:** Identify where shots are coming from
- **Caliber:** Larger guns sound different
- **Distance:** Learn to estimate range by sound

**Audio Settings:**
- Increase engine and track sound volume
- Enable "Hear Your Own Engine" for immersion
- Use headphones for better directional audio
- Adjust aircraft sound to hear CAS approaching

### Basic Ground RB Concepts

**Crossfire:**
- Engaging enemies from multiple angles
- Makes it harder for enemies to use cover
- Coordinate with teammates (even without voice chat, positioning creates crossfires)
- Never engage from the same angle as teammates if possible

**Flanking:**
- Moving around the sides of the battle to attack from behind
- Requires map knowledge and patience
- Don't overextend—flanking that takes 5 minutes is useless if you die immediately
- Use light tanks or fast mediums for flanking

**Hull-Down Play:**
- Positioning so only your turret is exposed
- Hides your weak hull armor
- Use hills, rubble, and terrain features
- Essential for survival at higher BRs

**Why Not to Yolo-Cap Alone:**
- Capture points are death traps
- Enemies watch caps and will kill you
- Capping alone exposes you from multiple angles
- Only cap when:
  - You have teammate support
  - You've cleared the area
  - You're in a fast vehicle and can escape quickly

### Training Missions

**Mission A: Survival Focus (5 matches)**
- **Goal:** Survive at least 5 minutes per spawn
- **Rules:** Don't worry about kills or caps
- **Focus:** Use cover, check minimap, avoid unnecessary risks
- **Success Criteria:** Average survival time > 5 minutes

**Mission B: Minimap Awareness (5 matches)**
- **Goal:** Check minimap every 5 seconds
- **Rules:** Set a timer if needed
- **Focus:** Read the map, understand teammate positions, identify gaps
- **Success Criteria:** No deaths from flanking (you saw it coming on minimap)

**Mission C: Weakspot Mastery (10 matches)**
- **Goal:** Only fire at known weakspots
- **Rules:** If you don't know the weakspot, don't fire (or use test drive to learn)
- **Focus:** Aim carefully, wait for good shots
- **Success Criteria:** >70% of shots penetrate (check after-battle report)

**Mission D: Map Learning (10 matches on same map)**
- **Goal:** Learn one map thoroughly
- **Rules:** Play the same map repeatedly (use map preferences if available)
- **Focus:** Learn routes, positions, cover locations
- **Success Criteria:** You can predict where enemies will be

**Mission E: Sound Awareness (5 matches)**
- **Goal:** Identify enemies by sound before seeing them
- **Rules:** Rely more on audio than visual
- **Focus:** Listen for engines, tracks, aircraft
- **Success Criteria:** Successfully identify and engage 3+ enemies you heard first

### CAS and SPAA Usage

**When to Start Using CAS:**
- After you have 50+ battles and understand ground combat basics
- When you have a proper aircraft in your lineup
- When you understand aircraft controls (practice in Air AB first)

**CAS Basics:**
- Spawn in aircraft after using ground spawns
- Target exposed enemies (not those in cover)
- Learn to dive-bomb or use rockets effectively
- Don't waste aircraft spawn on a guaranteed death

**SPAA Usage:**
- Always include SPAA in your lineup
- Use SPAA to counter enemy aircraft
- Learn to lead aircraft (practice in Test Drive)
- SPAA can also engage light vehicles and open-topped tanks
- Don't spawn SPAA as your first vehicle (save for aircraft threats)

### Learning One Lineup Per Nation

**Why Focus on One Lineup:**
- Mastery > Variety: Knowing one lineup well is better than knowing many poorly
- Crew Training: Focusing on one lineup allows you to train crews effectively
- Map Knowledge: Playing the same vehicles helps you learn maps
- Economic Efficiency: Fewer vehicles to repair and maintain

**When to Expand:**
- After 100 battles, you can start a second nation
- Or, build a second lineup at a different BR in the same nation
- Don't spread yourself too thin—mastery takes time

**Lineup Specialization:**
- Learn your vehicles' strengths and weaknesses
- Know which maps favor your lineup
- Understand matchups against common enemies
- Develop specific tactics for your vehicles

## 6. Phase IV — Battles 100 to 200: Choosing a Path & Avoiding Burnout

### Decision Point: Your Path Forward

By battle 100, you should have a solid foundation. Now you must choose your path:

1. **Primary Nation:** Which nation will you focus on?
2. **Main Game Mode:** Ground RB, Air RB, or both?
3. **Target BR Range:** Where do you want to specialize?

These decisions will guide your progression for the next 100+ battles.

### Choosing Your Primary Nation

**Factors to Consider:**
- **Playstyle Fit:** Does the nation match how you like to play?
- **Vehicle Enjoyment:** Do you enjoy the vehicles?
- **Economic Viability:** Can you afford to progress in this nation?
- **Learning Curve:** Are you comfortable with the nation's characteristics?

**Nation Characteristics Summary:**

| Nation | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best For |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| USA | Gun depression, versatility, CAS | Weak early armor | Flexible players |
| Germany | Excellent guns, good armor (mid-tier) | Poor gun depression, weak early | Aggressive players |
| USSR | Good armor, powerful guns | Poor gun depression, slow | Defensive players |
| UK | High penetration, accurate | Solid shot requires precision | Skilled players |
| Japan | Fast, maneuverable | Weak armor, requires skill | Flanking players |
| France | Unique vehicles, good mid-tier | Weak early, expensive | Experienced players |
| Italy | Fast, good flankers | Weak armor | Mobile players |
| Sweden | High penetration, unique | Limited vehicle selection | Specialized players |
| China | Mix of USSR/USA | Less unique identity | Versatile players |

**Recommendation:** If you haven't chosen by battle 100, stick with USA, Germany, or USSR. These nations are forgiving and teach different playstyles.

### Main Game Mode Selection

**Ground RB Focus:**
- Most popular mode
- Good balance of realism and accessibility
- Higher rewards than AB
- Requires map knowledge and positioning

**Air RB Focus:**
- Different skill set (flight mechanics, energy management)
- Can complement Ground RB (CAS)
- Higher skill ceiling
- Different economy considerations

**Both Modes:**
- Most versatile approach
- CAS skills help in Ground RB
- More time investment required
- Better overall game understanding

**Recommendation:** Focus on Ground RB initially, but learn basic Air RB for CAS purposes.

### Target BR Range Selection

**Staying in Mid-Tier (4.0–7.0):**
- **Pros:**
  - Best economy (manageable repair costs)
  - Most balanced gameplay
  - Where fundamentals matter most
  - Active player base
  - Fun, diverse vehicles
- **Cons:**
  - Not "top tier" (if that matters to you)
  - Some players prefer modern vehicles

**Advancing to High-Tier (7.0+):**
- **Pros:**
  - Modern vehicles
  - Different gameplay (faster, more lethal)
  - Prestige of high-tier
- **Cons:**
  - Much higher repair costs
  - Requires deeper knowledge
  - Less forgiving of mistakes
  - Can be frustrating without fundamentals

**Recommendation:** Stay in mid-tier (4.0–7.0) until battle 200+. Master fundamentals before advancing.

### Premium Time, Premium Vehicles, and Talismans

**Premium Time:**
- **What It Does:** Doubles RP and SL earnings
- **When to Consider:** If you enjoy the game and want faster progression
- **Cost:** ~$10–15 per month
- **Value:** High if you play regularly
- **Warning:** Don't buy if you're not sure you'll play consistently

**Premium Vehicles:**
- **What They Do:** Earn more RP/SL, help grind tech trees
- **When to Consider:** After 100+ battles, when you know what you want
- **Cost:** $10–60+ depending on vehicle
- **Value:** Varies—research before buying
- **Warning:** Don't buy high-tier premiums without mid-tier experience

**Talismans:**
- **What They Do:** Double RP earnings on a specific vehicle
- **When to Consider:** When you have a vehicle you love and perform well in
- **Cost:** Golden Eagles (varies by tier)
- **Value:** Good if you play that vehicle frequently
- **Warning:** Only buy for vehicles you'll use long-term

**General Advice:**
- **Never feel pressured to spend money.** The game is fully playable without spending.
- **If you do spend, wait until battle 100+** so you know what you want.
- **Research purchases:** Read reviews, watch videos, understand what you're buying.
- **Avoid "pay to win" mentality:** Premium vehicles don't make you a better player.

### Pros and Cons: Mid-Tier vs. High-Tier

**Mid-Tier (4.0–7.0) Advantages:**
- Manageable economy (repair costs 2,000–8,000 SL)
- Balanced gameplay (not too fast, not too slow)
- Fundamentals-focused (positioning and aim matter more than vehicle)
- Active player base
- Diverse vehicle types
- Fun, engaging matches

**Mid-Tier Disadvantages:**
- Not "top tier" (some players want modern vehicles)
- Slower progression to high-tier
- Some vehicles feel "outdated"

**High-Tier (7.0+) Advantages:**
- Modern vehicles
- Faster-paced gameplay
- Different tactical considerations
- Prestige

**High-Tier Disadvantages:**
- Expensive (repair costs 8,000–20,000+ SL)
- Requires deep knowledge
- Less forgiving
- Can be frustrating without fundamentals
- Often dominated by experienced players

**Recommendation:** Learn fundamentals at 4.0–7.0. Advance to high-tier only after mastering mid-tier.

### Recommended Learning BR Brackets

## 7. Mindset & Psychology for New Players

### Tilt Management

**What is Tilt?** Tilt is emotional frustration that causes poor decision-making. In War Thunder, tilt leads to:
- Rushing into bad positions
- Taking unnecessary risks
- Ignoring fundamentals
- Rage-quitting
- Making poor economic decisions

**Recognizing Tilt:**
- Feeling angry or frustrated after deaths
- Blaming teammates or "OP vehicles" for losses
- Playing worse after a bad match
- Wanting to "get revenge" on enemies
- Ignoring your own mistakes

**Managing Tilt:**
- **Take Breaks:** If you lose 3 matches in a row, take a 10-minute break
- **Analyze Objectively:** After each death, ask "What could I have done differently?"
- **Focus on Learning:** Every death teaches you something
- **Set Realistic Expectations:** You will die. You will lose. This is normal.
- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Surviving longer, getting a good shot, learning a new weakspot

**The 3-Death Rule:** If you die 3 times in a row within 2 minutes each, stop playing for 30 minutes. You're tilted and need to reset.

### Not Obsessing Over K/D

**Why K/D Doesn't Matter Early:**
- Your first 100 battles are for learning, not statistics
- Good players have negative K/D initially
- K/D improves naturally as you learn
- Focusing on K/D causes bad habits (camping, avoiding fights)

**What Matters Instead:**
- **Survival Time:** Are you living longer?
- **Learning:** Are you understanding the game better?
- **Improvement:** Are you making fewer mistakes?
- **Enjoyment:** Are you having fun?

**When K/D Matters:**
- After 200+ battles, K/D becomes a useful metric
- It indicates whether you're improving
- But it's still not the only metric that matters

**Healthy K/D Goals:**
- Battles 0–50: Don't worry about it
- Battles 50–100: Aim for 0.5+ (1 kill per 2 deaths)
- Battles 100–200: Aim for 0.8+ (approaching 1:1)
- After 200: Aim for 1.0+ (positive K/D)

### Using Losses as Data

**Every Loss Teaches:**
- What positions are dangerous
- What vehicles are threats
- What tactics enemies use
- What mistakes you made

**After Each Loss, Ask:**
1. Why did I die? (specific reason)
2. What could I have done differently?
3. What did the enemy do that worked?
4. What can I learn from this?

**Loss Analysis Framework:**
- **Early Death (< 2 minutes):** Positioning mistake, didn't use cover, overextended
- **Mid-Match Death (2–8 minutes):** Tactical mistake, wrong engagement, poor awareness
- **Late-Match Death (8+ minutes):** Good survival, but made a mistake under pressure

**The Growth Mindset:**
- Bad players blame external factors (teammates, vehicles, RNG)
- Good players focus on what they can control (their own play)
- Every death is a learning opportunity
- Improvement comes from analyzing mistakes, not from winning

### Learning to Love Dying with Information

**The Information Death:**
- You died, but you learned something valuable
- You now know an enemy position
- You understand a weakspot better
- You identified a map route

**Examples of Information Deaths:**
- Died to a sniper → Now you know that position
- Died to a flanker → Now you know that route exists
- Died to CAS → Now you know to avoid open areas
- Died testing a weakspot → Now you know it doesn't work

**The Value of Information:**
- Information deaths are investments in future success
- Each death makes you smarter
- Players who avoid all risk never learn
- Calculated risks that result in information deaths are valuable

**Reframing Death:**
- Instead of: "I died, this game is stupid"
- Think: "I died, but I learned X. Next time I'll do Y differently."

### Avoiding Burnout

**Signs of Burnout:**
- Not enjoying the game
- Playing out of obligation, not fun
- Feeling frustrated constantly
- Performance declining
- Wanting to quit

**Preventing Burnout:**
- **Take Regular Breaks:** Don't play for 6+ hours straight
- **Set Goals:** Have specific, achievable goals (not just "get better")
- **Variety:** Play different BRs, nations, or modes
- **Social Play:** Play with friends or join a squadron
- **Focus on Fun:** If you're not having fun, take a break

**Healthy Play Schedule:**
- **Daily:** 1–2 hours is sustainable
- **Weekly:** 10–15 hours prevents burnout
- **Take Days Off:** Don't play every single day
- **Listen to Your Body:** If you're tired or frustrated, stop

**The Long Game:**
- War Thunder is a marathon, not a sprint
- Players who rush burn out faster
- Slow, steady progress is sustainable
- Enjoy the journey, not just the destination

### Final Summary

**The Path from 0 to 200 Battles:**

1. **Battles 0–10:** Learn basic mechanics against bots. Don't develop bad habits.

2. **Battles 10–50:** Survive the economy wall. Build a proper lineup. Learn fundamentals.

3. **Battles 50–100:** Enter real PvP. Develop map knowledge, awareness, and positioning.

4. **Battles 100–200:** Choose your path. Specialize in a nation and BR range. Master fundamentals.

**Key Principles:**
- Survival > Kills
- Fundamentals > Vehicle Unlocks
- Learning > Winning
- Patience > Rushing

**Success Metrics:**
- Positive SL income
- Improving survival time
- Growing knowledge base
- Enjoying the game

**Remember:** War Thunder is a complex game that rewards patience and learning. Players who rush to high tier without fundamentals consistently struggle. Players who invest time in proper training become skilled, economically stable, and enjoy the game long-term.

**Your journey from battle 0 to 200 is just the beginning.** After 200 battles, you'll have a solid foundation to specialize, advance, and truly master War Thunder. But the fundamentals you learn in these first 200 battles will serve you for thousands of battles to come.
