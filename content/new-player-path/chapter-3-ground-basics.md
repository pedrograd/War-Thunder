# Chapter 3: Ground Forces Basics

Now that you've chosen your nation, it's time to learn the fundamentals of ground forces combat. This chapter covers the essential concepts you need to succeed in tank battles.

## Understanding Your Role

### Vehicle Types

**Light Tanks**:
- Fast and mobile
- Good for scouting and flanking
- Weak armor, rely on speed
- Best for: Learning map awareness, flanking tactics

**Medium Tanks**:
- Balanced characteristics
- Versatile and adaptable
- Good for: Learning all aspects of tank combat
- **Recommended for beginners**: Start here!

**Heavy Tanks**:
- Strong armor and powerful guns
- Slower and less mobile
- Best for: Defensive play, learning armor mechanics
- **Not recommended for beginners**: Too slow, teaches bad habits

**Tank Destroyers (TDs)**:
- Powerful guns, often no turret
- Good for: Learning positioning and aiming
- **Not recommended for beginners**: Limited mobility

**SPAA (Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft)**:
- Designed to shoot down aircraft
- Can be effective against light vehicles
- **Not for beginners**: Specialized role

## Basic Combat Concepts

### Positioning is Everything

**Key Principle**: Where you are matters more than what vehicle you're in.

**Good Positioning**:
- Behind cover (hills, buildings, debris)
- Hull down (only turret visible)
- Angled to increase armor effectiveness
- Near teammates for support
- With escape routes available

**Bad Positioning**:
- In open fields with no cover
- Exposing your side armor
- Alone without support
- No escape route
- Bottom of a hill (enemies above you)

### Using Cover

**Types of Cover**:
- **Hard Cover**: Buildings, rocks, hills (blocks shells)
- **Soft Cover**: Bushes, trees (hides you but doesn't block shells)
- **Hull Down**: Terrain that hides your hull

**How to Use Cover**:
1. Always position near cover
2. Use cover to hide weak spots
3. Peek out to shoot, then hide
4. Don't stay in one position too long

### Aiming Basics

**Where to Aim**:
1. **Weak Spots**: Lower front plate, sides, rear
2. **Flat Armor**: Avoid angled armor when possible
3. **Crew/Modules**: Gunner, ammo racks, engine

**Aiming Tips**:
- Take your time to aim
- Wait for enemy to stop moving
- Aim for center of weak spot
- Don't rush shots

### Understanding Armor Angles

**Basic Rule**: Angled armor is harder to penetrate.

**What This Means**:
- Don't face enemies directly
- Angle your tank 15-30° from threat
- Don't expose side armor
- Use terrain to angle naturally

## Basic Tactics

### Hull Down Position

**What it is**: Hiding your hull behind cover, showing only turret

**Why it works**:
- Only small target for enemies
- Turret armor is usually stronger
- Harder for enemies to hit weak spots

**How to do it**:
1. Find a hill or elevated position
2. Reverse until only turret shows
3. Engage enemies from this position
4. Move back to reload

### Flanking

**What it is**: Attacking enemies from the side or rear

**Why it works**:
- Side and rear armor is much weaker
- Enemies are focused on front
- Easier to penetrate and destroy

**How to do it**:
1. Use mobility to move around
2. Wait for enemies to engage teammates
3. Attack from side or rear
4. Don't engage from front

### Supporting Teammates

**Key Principle**: War Thunder is a team game.

**How to Support**:
- Follow teammates, don't go solo
- Cover teammates' flanks
- Share information (use markers)
- Help when teammates are engaged
- Don't abandon teammates

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Rushing into Battle

**What happens**: You drive straight into enemy fire and die quickly

**How to avoid**:
- Take your time
- Observe the map first
- Follow teammates
- Use cover

### Mistake 2: Ignoring the Minimap

**What happens**: You get flanked and killed from behind

**How to avoid**:
- Check minimap frequently
- Watch for red markers (enemies)
- Be aware of your surroundings
- Don't tunnel vision on one target

### Mistake 3: Not Using Cover

**What happens**: You're an easy target in open areas

**How to avoid**:
- Always position near cover
- Use hills, buildings, debris
- Don't stay in open fields
- Plan your route with cover

### Mistake 4: Exposing Side Armor

**What happens**: Enemies penetrate your weak side armor easily

**How to avoid**:
- Angle your tank properly
- Don't turn to expose sides
- Use cover to protect sides
- Be aware of flanking enemies

### Mistake 5: Playing Solo

**What happens**: You get overwhelmed by multiple enemies

**How to avoid**:
- Stay with teammates
- Support each other
- Don't rush ahead alone
- Work as a team

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Positioning Practice

1. Start a match in Arcade mode
2. Don't rush forward immediately
3. Find a good position with cover
4. Observe the map and enemy positions
5. Engage only when you have advantage

**Goal**: Survive longer, get better positioning

### Exercise 2: Hull Down Practice

1. Find a hill or elevated position
2. Practice reversing until only turret shows
3. Engage enemies from this position
4. Move back to reload
5. Repeat

**Goal**: Master hull down positioning

### Exercise 3: Aiming Practice

1. In a match, take time to aim
2. Aim for weak spots (lower front plate, sides)
3. Wait for good shots
4. Don't rush your shots

**Goal**: Improve accuracy and penetration

## What to Focus On

**As a Beginner, Focus On**:
1. **Survival**: Don't die immediately
2. **Positioning**: Always use cover
3. **Aiming**: Take time to aim for weak spots
4. **Teamwork**: Stay with teammates
5. **Map Awareness**: Check minimap frequently

**Don't Worry About Yet**:
- Advanced tactics
- Complex maneuvers
- High-tier vehicles
- Competitive strategies

## Progression Tips

- Focus on learning controls
- Practice positioning
- Learn map layouts
- Don't worry about mistakes

**Mid Tiers (BR 2.0-4.0)**:
