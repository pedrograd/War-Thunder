- **Focus on shooting and penetration** → Germany

## Recommended Starting Nation: USA

For complete beginners, **USA is the recommended starting nation** because:

1. **Balanced Characteristics**: Not too strong in any area, teaches fundamentals
2. **Good Gun Depression**: Easier to use hills and cover effectively
3. **Versatile Vehicles**: Can learn different playstyles
4. **Good Progression**: Strong vehicles at most BR tiers
5. **Forgiving**: Good mobility helps you reposition from mistakes

## What to Expect in Your First Nation

## Important: You Can Change Later!

**Remember**: You're not locked into one nation forever. After you learn the basics with your first nation, you can:

- **Research other nations** anytime
- **Keep your progress** in your first nation
- **Learn different playstyles** by playing multiple nations
- **Build lineups** across multiple nations

## Practice Exercise

### Exercise: Nation Research

1. Open the Research Tree for USA, Germany, and Russia
2. Compare their vehicles at BR 1.0-2.0
3. Note the differences in vehicle types
4. Check which nation's playstyle appeals to you most

## Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Starting with advanced nations**: Sweden, Israel, etc. are too complex for beginners
2. **Focusing only on one nation**: Eventually, you'll want to understand other nations to counter them
3. **Rushing to high tiers**: Stay in low tiers to learn fundamentals first
4. **Ignoring nation characteristics**: Each nation plays differently - learn to use your nation's strengths

## What's Next?

Once you've chosen your nation, it's time to learn the fundamentals of ground forces combat! In **Chapter 3: Ground Forces Basics**, we'll teach you the core concepts of tank combat.
