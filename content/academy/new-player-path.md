# New Player Path – 0 to 200 Battles

Welcome to War Thunder. This guide will take you from your first confused battle to becoming a competent player who understands the game's core mechanics and can contribute meaningfully to your team. This path focuses primarily on Ground Realistic Battles, as it's the most popular mode and teaches fundamental skills that transfer to other modes.

> **Important:** This guide assumes you're starting from zero. If you've already played some battles, you can skip ahead to relevant sections, but reading the full guide will help you identify gaps in your knowledge.

## Introduction: What You're Actually Learning

War Thunder isn't just a tank game—it's a combined arms military simulation with deep mechanics. Your first 200 battles are about building a foundation that will serve you for thousands of hours of gameplay.

**What separates good players from great ones isn't vehicle choice or raw reflexes—it's understanding the game's systems and making smart decisions consistently.**

This path is designed to build that understanding systematically. We'll cover:
- Core game mechanics and how they actually work
- Fundamental survival skills that keep you alive
- Tactical awareness that helps you contribute to your team
- Common mistakes that kill new players (and how to avoid them)
- A structured improvement plan that builds skills progressively

> **Meta Insight:** The players who succeed long-term aren't the ones who rush to high tiers—they're the ones who master fundamentals at low tiers and build skills progressively. This guide teaches you to be one of those players.

## 1. How War Thunder Actually Works

Before diving into tactics, you need to understand the game's core systems. Many new players struggle because they don't understand how these systems interact.

### Battle Rating (BR) – The Matchmaking System

**What BR Actually Means**: Every vehicle has a Battle Rating that determines matchmaking. You'll face vehicles within approximately 1.0 BR of your highest vehicle. A 3.7 BR tank can face enemies from 2.7 to 4.7 BR.

**Why This Matters**: This means you'll sometimes be the strongest vehicle, sometimes the weakest. Learning to fight both situations is crucial. A 3.7 tank facing 4.7 enemies is "uptiered"—you're at a disadvantage. A 3.7 tank facing 2.7 enemies is "downtiered"—you have an advantage.

**The Reality**: You'll be uptiered more often than downtiered. This is normal. Don't let it frustrate you—learn to play at a disadvantage. This skill transfers to every BR.

> **Pro Tip:** When uptiered, focus on support roles. Scout enemies, capture objectives, support stronger teammates. You don't need to carry the team—just contribute meaningfully.

### Research Points (RP) and Silver Lions (SL) – The Economy

**RP (Research Points)**: Unlocks new vehicles and modifications. You earn RP through battle performance—kills, assists, captures, scouting, and time alive all contribute.

**SL (Silver Lions)**: The currency for purchasing vehicles, modifications, crew training, and repairs. Every battle earns both, but dying costs SL in repair bills.

**The Critical Concept**: The goal is to earn more SL than you spend. This sounds obvious, but many players lose SL consistently because they:
- Die early in expensive vehicles
- Don't build proper lineups (can't respawn effectively)
- Rush to high tiers where repair costs are punishing
- Don't understand how to survive long enough to earn rewards

**How Rewards Actually Work**: 
- Battle activity (time alive and active) significantly affects rewards
- Multiple spawns = more battle activity = better rewards
- Surviving longer = better rewards
- Contributing to team victory = bonus rewards

> **Economy Insight:** A player who goes 2-1 but survives 8 minutes and contributes to victory earns more than a player who goes 5-3 but dies in 2 minutes. Survival and contribution matter more than raw kills.

### Crews and Lineups – The Foundation of Success

**Crews**: Your crew represents the soldiers operating your vehicle. Crew skills affect:
- Reload speed (loader skill)
- Repair time (repair skill)
- Targeting accuracy (targeting skill)
- Survivability (vitality skill)
- And more

**Why Crews Matter**: A well-trained crew significantly improves vehicle performance. A vehicle with expert crew performs noticeably better than the same vehicle with basic crew.

**Lineups**: Your selection of vehicles for a battle. You can spawn multiple times if you have enough Spawn Points (SP). A good lineup has 3-5 usable vehicles at the same BR.

**Why Lineups Matter**: 
- Multiple spawns = more battle activity = better rewards
- Different vehicles for different situations (need a light tank? Spawn one)
- Economic safety (if one vehicle dies early, you can still contribute)
- Team contribution (staying in battle longer helps your team)

> **Warning:** Many new players bring only one vehicle to battle. This is a critical mistake. You die once, match over, minimal rewards. Build proper lineups from the start.

### Realistic Battles vs Arcade – Why RB Matters

**Arcade Battles** give you:
- Penetration indicators (shows if you can penetrate)
- Enemy markers (shows where enemies are)
- Faster movement
- Easier respawns

**Realistic Battles** removes most assists:
- No penetration indicators (you must learn weakspots)
- No enemy markers (you must identify enemies yourself)
- Realistic movement and physics
- More careful gameplay required

**Why Most Experienced Players Prefer RB**: 
- Teaches real skills (weakspot knowledge, identification, positioning)
- More tactical depth
- Better rewards (generally)
- More satisfying gameplay

**This Guide Focuses on RB**: Because it teaches skills that transfer everywhere. Master RB, and Arcade becomes trivial. Master Arcade, and you still need to learn RB skills.

> **Important:** If you're completely new, it's fine to play a few Arcade battles to learn basic controls. But switch to RB as soon as you're comfortable with movement and aiming. Don't develop Arcade habits that hurt you in RB.

## 2. Phase I — Battles 0–10: Bot Purgatory

Your first few battles will likely include bots. This gives false confidence—real players are much smarter and more dangerous.

### Main Goals

- **Learn basic controls**: Movement, aiming, firing, switching ammo types
- **Understand the aiming system**: How to lead targets, where to aim
- **Grasp the weakspot concept**: Not all armor is equal—some spots are vulnerable
- **Learn vehicle identification**: Recognize common vehicles by silhouette

### The Bot Trap

**What Happens**: Your first battles include bots. Bots are predictable, easy to kill, and give false confidence.

**The Reality**: Real players are unpredictable, smart, and dangerous. The difficulty spike when you face real players is significant.

**How to Prepare**: Don't get overconfident. Use bot battles to learn mechanics, not to feel skilled. Real skill comes from facing real players.

### Checklist

- [ ] Can you move, aim, and fire without thinking about controls?
- [ ] Do you understand how to switch between ammo types?
- [ ] Can you identify enemy vehicles by silhouette?
- [ ] Do you know where to aim on common low-tier tanks?
- [ ] Have you learned to use third-person camera effectively?
- [ ] Can you read the minimap and understand what it shows?
- [ ] Do you understand how capture points work?

### Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**YOLO Rushing**: Charging straight at the enemy. You'll die immediately against real players.

**Why It Happens**: Bot battles make this seem effective. Bots don't react well to aggressive rushes.

**The Fix**: Always move from cover to cover. Never cross open ground without a plan. Use third-person camera to check angles before exposing yourself.

**Tunnel Vision**: Focusing only on what's in front of you. Enemies flank constantly.

**Why It Happens**: It's natural to focus on immediate threats. But War Thunder is a 360-degree battlefield.

**The Fix**: Check your minimap every 5 seconds. Look around constantly. Listen for engine sounds. Assume enemies are everywhere until proven otherwise.

**Ignoring the Minimap**: The minimap shows friendly positions, capture points, and sometimes enemy markers. Use it.

**Why It Happens**: New players focus on the main screen. The minimap seems secondary.

**The Fix**: Make checking the minimap a habit. Set a mental timer—every 5 seconds, glance at the minimap. This becomes automatic with practice.

**Standing Still After Firing**: After you shoot, you're visible and vulnerable. Move immediately.

**Why It Happens**: Players want to see if their shot hit. But staying still gets you killed.

**The Fix**: Fire, then immediately reverse or move to a new position. Don't peek the same spot twice. Movement is survival.

**Not Using Cover**: Open ground is a death sentence. Always move between cover.

**Why It Happens**: Players want to get to objectives quickly. But speed without cover gets you killed.

**The Fix**: Plan routes that use cover. Hills, buildings, destroyed vehicles—all provide cover. Use them constantly.

### Simple Drills

> **Drill: Target Identification**  
> Load into a test drive or custom battle. Practice identifying vehicles by silhouette from different angles. Learn the difference between light, medium, heavy, and tank destroyer shapes. Repeat until you can identify common vehicles instantly.  
> **Time**: 10-15 minutes daily for first week  
> **Goal**: Instant vehicle recognition

> **Drill: Weakspot Practice**  
> In test drive, practice aiming at specific weakspots: lower front plate, turret ring, driver ports. Learn to hit these spots while moving. Practice from different ranges.  
> **Time**: 10 minutes daily  
> **Goal**: Consistent weakspot hits

> **Drill: Cover Movement**  
> In a custom battle, practice moving between cover points. Learn to peek, shoot, and retreat. Practice using reverse gear to back into cover.  
> **Time**: 15 minutes daily  
> **Goal**: Smooth cover-to-cover movement

> **Drill: Minimap Awareness**  
> Every 5 seconds, check your minimap. Note where teammates are positioned. Identify gaps in your team's coverage. Practice this until it becomes automatic.  
> **Time**: During every battle  
> **Goal**: Automatic minimap checking

> **Drill: Ammo Selection**  
> Learn when to use different ammo types. APHE for side shots and crew elimination. APCR for flat frontal armor. HE for open-top vehicles. Practice switching ammo quickly.  
> **Time**: 10 minutes in test drive  
> **Goal**: Quick, correct ammo selection

## 3. Phase II — Battles 10–50: Surviving Real Players

Now you're facing real players. The difficulty spike is significant. Your goal shifts from "get kills" to "don't die in the first 2 minutes."

### The Reality Check

**What Changes**: Real players are smart, unpredictable, and dangerous. They know weakspots, use positioning, and work together.

**Your New Goal**: Survival first. Dead players contribute nothing. Staying alive means more opportunities to help your team.

**The Mindset Shift**: Stop thinking "I need kills." Start thinking "I need to survive and contribute." Kills will come naturally as you improve.

### Focus Areas

**Survival First**: Dead players contribute nothing. Staying alive means more opportunities to help your team.

**Using Cover**: Every movement should be from cover to cover. Never cross open ground without a plan.

**Minimap Reading**: Your minimap is your best friend. Watch it constantly to understand the battle flow.

**Audio Awareness**: Engine sounds, gunfire direction, explosion locations—all tell you where enemies are. Use your ears.

### Golden Rules of Survival

1. **Never peek the same spot twice**: If you shot from a position, assume enemies are aiming at it. Move.

2. **Check angles before moving**: Use third-person camera to look around corners and over obstacles before exposing yourself.

3. **Listen for engine sounds**: Enemy vehicles make noise. Learn to identify engine sounds and use them to locate threats.

4. **Watch the killfeed**: When teammates die, note where and how. That tells you where enemies are.

5. **Don't push alone**: Always move with at least one teammate. Solo pushes get you killed.

6. **Repair in safety**: If you're damaged, retreat to a safe position before repairing. Don't repair in the open.

7. **Save your spawn points**: Don't waste SP on a bad spawn. Wait for a good opportunity.

8. **Assume enemies are everywhere**: Until proven otherwise, assume threats exist. This keeps you cautious and alive.

9. **Have an escape route**: Before engaging, know how you'll retreat. Always have a plan B.

10. **Don't fight losing battles**: If you're outnumbered, outpositioned, or damaged, retreat. Live to fight another spawn.

### Forgiving Low BR Nations

**USA (1.0-3.7)**: Stabilized guns at low speeds, good mobility, versatile vehicles. Forgiving for beginners. Excellent gun depression teaches hull-down positioning.

**USSR (1.0-3.7)**: Good armor, powerful guns, simple playstyle. T-34s teach angling basics. Straightforward vehicles are easy to learn.

**Germany (1.0-3.7)**: Excellent guns, good armor when angled. Teaches precision and positioning. Pz.IV F2 teaches long-range engagement.

**Why These BR Ranges**: These BR ranges are balanced and forgiving. Vehicles are simple, matches are slower, mistakes are less punishing. Stay here until you're comfortable with the basics.

> **Pro Tip:** Don't rush past 3.7 BR until you've mastered fundamentals. Many players rush to higher BRs and develop bad habits. Master low tier first.

### The Psychology of Early Deaths

**What Happens**: You die in the first 2 minutes. You feel frustrated. You want to spawn again immediately.

**The Reality**: Early deaths are learning opportunities. Every death teaches you something:
- Why did you die? (Positioning? Awareness? Bad decision?)
- What could you have done differently?
- What did the enemy do right?

**The Fix**: After each death, ask yourself: "What did I learn?" Don't just respawn mindlessly. Learn from every death.

> **Meta Insight:** Good players die less not because they're invincible, but because they learn from every death and avoid repeating mistakes. Every death is a lesson—make sure you're learning.

## 4. Phase III — Battles 50–100: Building a Real Lineup

You're no longer a complete beginner. Now you need to build proper lineups and understand team composition.

### Why 3+ Usable Vehicles Matter

A good lineup has multiple vehicles at the same BR. This means:
- You can spawn multiple times per battle
- You can adapt to different situations (need a light tank for scouting? Spawn one)
- You earn more RP and SL by staying in battle longer
- You contribute more to your team's victory

**The Economic Reality**: Players with full lineups earn significantly more RP and SL than players with single vehicles. This isn't just about convenience—it's about economic efficiency.

**The Tactical Reality**: Different situations require different vehicles. A heavy tank can't scout. A light tank can't anchor a position. A full lineup gives you options.

### Lineup Composition

**Core Vehicles (2-3)**: Your main fighting vehicles. Usually medium or heavy tanks. These are your primary spawns.

**Light Tank or Scout (1)**: For scouting enemies and flanking. Essential for team support. Scouting marks enemies for your entire team and gives bonus rewards.

**SPAA (1)**: Anti-aircraft vehicle. Protects your team from aircraft. Can also kill light vehicles. Essential at higher BRs where aircraft are common.

**CAS (Optional)**: Close Air Support aircraft. Useful for killing enemy tanks from above. Requires air research. Not essential early, but powerful later.

> **Pro Tip:** A balanced lineup gives you options for any situation. Don't bring only one vehicle type. Diversity wins battles.

### Picking BR Ranges for Learning

**Low Tier (1.0-3.7)**: Best for learning fundamentals. Vehicles are simple, matches are slower, mistakes are less punishing.

**Mid Tier (4.0-6.7)**: More complex vehicles, faster gameplay. Good for intermediate players. Heavy tanks and powerful guns appear.

**High Tier (7.0+)**: Requires deep knowledge. Don't rush here—you'll be a liability to your team. Modern MBTs, stabilizers, thermal imaging—all require experience.

**Recommendation**: Master 3.7 BR before moving up. Then master 5.7 before going higher. Each BR bracket teaches different skills.

> **Warning:** Rushing to high tiers is the #1 mistake new players make. You'll face experienced players in complex vehicles. You'll die constantly, lose SL, and develop bad habits. Master low tier first.

### When to Stop Changing Nations

Early on, it's fine to try different nations. But around battle 50-100, pick 1-2 nations and focus. 

**Why**: Constantly switching nations means you never develop deep knowledge of:
- Vehicle characteristics
- Weakspots
- Playstyles
- Lineup building

**The Fix**: Pick a nation you enjoy. Master it. Build multiple lineups. Learn its vehicles deeply. Then, if you want, try another nation. But don't constantly switch—depth beats breadth.

> **Meta Insight:** A player who masters one nation at 5.7 BR is better than a player who has vehicles from five nations but doesn't understand any of them. Specialization beats generalization early on.

## 5. Phase IV — Battles 100–200: Becoming a Team Asset

You understand the basics. Now focus on becoming a valuable team player who wins matches, not just gets kills.

### Advanced Concepts

**Scouting**: Light tanks can mark enemies for your team. Marked enemies are visible to everyone and give bonus rewards. Scout aggressively but safely.

**Flanking**: Attacking from the side or rear. Requires map knowledge and patience. High risk, high reward.

**Hull-Down Positioning**: Hiding your hull behind cover, exposing only your turret. Makes you much harder to kill. Essential for heavy tanks.

**Squad Play**: Even with random teammates, you can coordinate. Use the chat (sparingly), follow teammates, support their pushes.

**Crossfires**: Positioning multiple vehicles to fire at the same area from different angles. Creates kill zones enemies can't escape.

### From K/D Obsession → Win-Rate Mindset

**Bad Player**: "I got 5 kills but we lost. My team was trash."

**Good Player**: "We won because I scouted 8 enemies and held a key position."

**The Reality**: Kills matter, but winning matters more. A player who goes 1-0 but captures points and scouts enemies is more valuable than someone who goes 5-3 but contributes nothing to victory.

**Focus on**:
- Capturing and holding objectives
- Scouting enemies
- Supporting teammates
- Denying enemy advances
- Surviving to fight another spawn

> **Meta Insight:** Win rate is a better measure of skill than K/D ratio. Good players contribute to victories, not just personal stats. Focus on winning, and kills will come naturally.

### Understanding Battle Flow

**Early Game (0-2 minutes)**: Initial positioning, first engagements, map control establishment.

**Mid Game (2-5 minutes)**: Main engagements, flank development, objective control.

**Late Game (5+ minutes)**: Cleanup, spawn point management, victory securing.

**Your Role Changes**: Early game, you're establishing position. Mid game, you're fighting for control. Late game, you're securing victory. Understand which phase you're in and play accordingly.

## 6. Habits That Separate Good Players

These habits seem small but compound into significant skill advantages:

1. **Third-Person Angle Checks**: Before peeking, use third-person camera to check angles. Know what's around the corner.

2. **Pre-Aiming Common Angles**: When approaching a known enemy position, aim where they're likely to be. Reduces reaction time.

3. **Never Peek the Same Position Twice**: If you shot from somewhere, enemies are watching it. Always vary your position.

4. **Pulling Back When Damaged**: If your crew is injured or you're low on ammo, retreat to safety. Don't fight at a disadvantage.

5. **Watching the Minimap Constantly**: Check it every 5 seconds. Understand battle flow, identify threats, see opportunities.

6. **Listening for Audio Cues**: Engine sounds, gunfire direction, explosion locations—all tell you where enemies are.

7. **Managing Spawn Points**: Don't waste SP on bad spawns. Save for good opportunities. Sometimes not spawning is the right play.

8. **Using Terrain**: Hills, buildings, destroyed vehicles—all provide cover. Use them creatively.

9. **Ammo Management**: Don't carry full ammo loads. More ammo = more explosion risk. Carry 20-30 rounds for most tanks.

10. **Patience**: Good players wait for opportunities. Bad players rush and die. Sometimes the best move is to wait.

> **Pro Tip:** These habits don't develop overnight. Pick one habit, practice it for a week, then add another. Build them gradually. They'll become automatic with time.

## 7. Training Drills

Practice these drills regularly to build muscle memory and game sense:

> **Drill: Weakspot Recognition**  
> Load test drive with common enemy vehicles. Practice hitting weakspots from different angles and ranges. Repeat daily for 10 minutes until you can hit weakspots consistently.  
> **Frequency**: Daily for first month  
> **Goal**: Consistent weakspot accuracy

> **Drill: Cover Movement**  
> In custom battles, practice moving between cover points. Time yourself. Try to cross open ground as quickly as possible while using available cover. Practice peeking, shooting, and retreating.  
> **Frequency**: 3x per week  
> **Goal**: Smooth, safe movement

> **Drill: Minimap Awareness**  
> Set a timer for every 5 seconds. When it beeps, check your minimap and identify: where are teammates, where are gaps, where might enemies be. Do this for entire battles until it becomes automatic.  
> **Frequency**: Every battle for first 100 battles  
> **Goal**: Automatic minimap checking

> **Drill: Audio Recognition**  
> Play with headphones. Practice identifying vehicle types by engine sound. Learn to locate enemies by sound direction. This takes time but is incredibly valuable.  
> **Frequency**: Every battle  
> **Goal**: Audio-based threat detection

> **Drill: Angle Management**  
> Practice angling your armor correctly. In test drive, position yourself at different angles and note which angles bounce shots. Learn the "sweet spot" for your vehicles.  
> **Frequency**: When learning new vehicles  
> **Goal**: Optimal angling for each vehicle

> **Drill: Reverse Gear Usage**  
> Many players forget reverse exists. Practice backing into cover, reversing around corners, using reverse to escape. This is crucial for survival.  
> **Frequency**: 2x per week  
> **Goal**: Comfortable reverse movement

> **Drill: Multi-Target Engagement**  
> In custom battles, practice engaging multiple enemies. Learn to prioritize threats, manage reloads, and position to fight multiple opponents.  
> **Frequency**: Weekly  
> **Goal**: Effective multi-target combat

> **Drill: Objective Control**  
> Focus entire battles on capturing and holding objectives. Ignore kills. Learn to read when to push objectives and when to defend them.  
> **Frequency**: 5 battles per week  
> **Goal**: Objective-focused gameplay

> **Drill: Scouting Practice**  
> Play light tanks and focus only on scouting. Learn safe scouting routes, when to be aggressive, when to retreat. Master the scouting mechanic.  
> **Frequency**: When playing light tanks  
> **Goal**: Effective scouting

> **Drill: SPAA Practice**  
> Play SPAA and practice shooting down aircraft. Learn lead distances, aircraft behavior patterns, and when to engage vs when to hide.  
> **Frequency**: When playing SPAA  
> **Goal**: Effective air defense

## 8. Two-Week Improvement Plan

Use this structured plan to build skills systematically:

### Week 1: Survival Fundamentals

**Day 1-2**: Focus on staying alive. Don't worry about kills. Just survive as long as possible. Learn to use cover.

**Day 3-4**: Practice minimap awareness. Check it every 5 seconds. Understand what it tells you.

**Day 5-6**: Learn weakspot basics. Practice in test drive. Aim for lower front plates and turret rings.

**Day 7**: Review week. What did you learn? What needs work? Adjust for week 2.

### Week 2: Tactical Awareness

**Day 8-9**: Practice positioning. Learn hull-down positions. Use terrain effectively.

**Day 10-11**: Build your first real lineup. Get 3-4 vehicles at the same BR. Practice using different vehicles.

**Day 12-13**: Focus on team contribution. Scout enemies. Capture objectives. Support teammates.

**Day 14**: Review both weeks. Assess progress. Plan next steps.

> **Important:** This plan is a framework. Adjust based on your progress. Some players need more time on fundamentals. That's fine. Mastery beats speed.

## 9. Common Psychological Traps

**The "I Need Kills" Trap**: Focusing on kills instead of survival and contribution. Kills come naturally as you improve. Focus on fundamentals first.

**The "My Team is Bad" Trap**: Blaming teammates for losses. You can't control teammates, but you can control your own play. Focus on what you can improve.

**The "I Need Better Vehicles" Trap**: Thinking better vehicles will make you better. Skill matters more than vehicles. Master fundamentals with any vehicle.

**The "I Should Rush to High Tier" Trap**: Thinking high tier is better. Low tier teaches fundamentals. Master low tier first.

**The "I'm Not Improving" Trap**: Improvement is gradual. You won't notice day-to-day, but you'll notice week-to-week. Track progress over time, not battle-to-battle.

> **Meta Insight:** The players who succeed long-term are the ones who focus on improvement, not results. Every battle is practice. Every death is a lesson. Stay patient and focused.

## Conclusion

The path from battle 0 to 200 is about building fundamentals. Don't rush to high tiers. Master the basics at low BRs. Focus on survival, positioning, and team contribution over kills. The skills you build here will serve you at every BR.

**Remember**: War Thunder is a marathon, not a sprint. Every battle teaches you something. Stay patient, stay focused, and most importantly—have fun. Good luck, commander.

> **Final Pro Tip:** The best players aren't the ones who never make mistakes—they're the ones who learn from every mistake and avoid repeating them. Every death, every loss, every mistake is a learning opportunity. Make sure you're learning.
