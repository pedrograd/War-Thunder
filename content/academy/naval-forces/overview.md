## 1. Mission of the Naval Academy

**Purpose of the module**

The Naval Academy develops skilled naval commanders who can control sea lanes, engage surface targets effectively, manage anti-aircraft defense, and coordinate with aircraft. It standardizes terminology, emphasizes positioning and gunnery fundamentals, and explains how each ship class functions within Naval Realistic Battles. Graduates understand when to engage, when to retreat, how to use torpedoes effectively, and how to survive in the open ocean.

**Intended audience**

- Players new to naval combat who need structured guidance
- Ground or air players expanding into naval gameplay
- Experienced captains seeking to refine their tactics
- Squad leaders coordinating multi-ship operations

**Naval combat within War Thunder's meta**

- **Area control:** Naval vessels control sea lanes, blockade approaches to objectives, and provide fire support for coastal operations
- **Versatility:** Ships can engage surface, air, and submarine targets (when implemented), making them versatile assets
- **Economic efficiency:** Naval battles offer unique economic opportunities with different risk/reward profiles than ground or air combat
- **Combined arms:** Naval forces complement ground forces on coastal maps and support aircraft operations

**Connections to other Academy modules**

- **Ground Academy:** Understanding terrain and positioning principles applies to naval map control
- **Air Academy:** Naval AA operations and aircraft coordination are crucial for survival
- **Weapons & Systems:** Detailed knowledge of naval guns, torpedoes, and ammunition types
- **Map Tactics Academy:** Understanding naval map layouts, island positions, and objective locations
- **Meta Hub:** Staying current with ship balance, BR changes, and lineup recommendations

> **Pro Tip (Naval):** Naval combat requires patience and positioning. Unlike tanks or aircraft, ships cannot easily disengage once committed. Study positioning before focusing on gunnery.

## 2. Fundamentals of Naval Combat

### 2.1 Ship Classes Overview (Qualitative)

Naval vessels in War Thunder fall into distinct categories:

**Torpedo Boats (Coastal):**
- Small, fast, lightly armored
- Primary weapon: Torpedoes
- Role: Hit-and-run attacks, scouting, anti-ship ambushes
- Vulnerable to: Everything (guns, aircraft, other torpedoes)

**Gunboats (Coastal):**
- Small to medium size, moderate speed
- Primary weapon: Small-caliber rapid-fire guns
- Role: Close-range engagement, anti-boat defense
- Vulnerable to: Larger ships, aircraft

**Destroyers:**
- Medium size, good speed and maneuverability
- Primary weapons: Medium-caliber guns, torpedoes, depth charges
- Role: Multi-purpose surface combatant, convoy escort, anti-submarine warfare
- Vulnerable to: Cruisers, coordinated attacks, aircraft

**Light Cruisers:**
- Large size, moderate speed, good armor
- Primary weapons: Large-caliber guns, torpedoes (some), extensive AA
- Role: Surface combat, AA screen, long-range fire support
- Vulnerable to: Heavy cruisers, battleships, torpedoes

**Heavy Cruisers:**
- Very large, heavy armor, slower than light cruisers
- Primary weapons: Very large-caliber guns, torpedoes (some), AA batteries
- Role: Flagship operations, fleet combat, area denial
- Vulnerable to: Battleships, multiple destroyers, aircraft

> **Warning:** Don't rush into high-tier ships without learning fundamentals. Heavy cruisers are expensive to repair and unforgiving of mistakes.

### 2.2 Core Naval Concepts

**Range vs. Close Combat:**
- Long-range (5–10+ km): Reduced accuracy, more time to react, safer
- Medium range (2–5 km): Balance of accuracy and reaction time
- Close range (< 2 km): Maximum accuracy, torpedo threat, little time to react

**Armor Zones:**
- **Belt armor:** Main armor protecting the hull sides
- **Deck armor:** Horizontal protection against plunging fire
- **Citadel:** Protected area containing engines, magazines, critical systems
- **Superstructure:** Less protected upper works, vulnerable to HE shells

**Ammunition Types:**
- **AP (Armor Piercing):** High penetration, low damage, requires precise hits on armored areas
- **SAP (Semi-Armor Piercing):** Balanced penetration and damage, versatile
- **HE (High Explosive):** High damage, low penetration, effective against light armor and superstructure
- **HE-VT (Variable Time):** Proximity-fused HE for anti-aircraft use

**Angling:**
- Ships can angle their hulls to increase effective armor thickness
- Angling exposes different armor zones
- Too much angling can expose vulnerable areas

### 2.3 Positional Fundamentals

**Line of Sight (LoS):**
- Ships must have clear line of sight to engage targets
- Islands, smoke, and terrain block vision
- Use terrain to control engagement ranges

**Cover and Concealment:**
- **Cover:** Islands, terrain that physically blocks shells
- **Concealment:** Smoke screens, distance, weather that hides you
- Best positions offer both

**Choke Points:**
- Narrow passages between islands
- Approaches to objectives
- These areas create natural kill zones

**Flanking Routes:**
- Around the edges of maps
- Through narrow channels
- Requires speed and risk-taking

---

## 3. Gunnery & Fire Control

### 3.1 Basic Gunnery Principles

**Lead Calculation:**
- Targets move at varying speeds and angles
- Must aim ahead of target based on:
  - Target speed
  - Target angle (relative bearing)
  - Shell flight time
  - Distance to target

**Range Estimation:**
- Use rangefinders (if equipped)
- Estimate visually (takes practice)
- Use minimap distance markers
- Account for shell drop at long range

**Salvo Patterns:**
- **Straddling:** Shells fall on both sides of target, adjust aim to center
- **Bracketing:** Fire salvos at different ranges to find correct distance
- **Ladder:** Progressive range adjustments to "walk" onto target

### 3.2 Main Battery Gunnery

**Bore-Sighting:**
- Different turrets may have slight alignment differences
- Test fire to understand your ship's ballistics
- Adjust aim based on which turrets are firing

**Sustained Fire:**
- Maintain fire discipline to conserve ammunition
- Adjust aim between salvos based on splash patterns
- Don't fire blindly—each shot should be calculated

**Target Selection:**
- Prioritize threats: ships engaging you directly
- High-value targets: ships controlling objectives
- Vulnerable targets: damaged ships, isolated ships
- Don't waste ammunition on targets outside effective range

### 3.3 Secondary Battery Usage

**Secondary guns:**
- Smaller-caliber rapid-fire weapons
- Effective against small ships, aircraft, exposed crews
- Can finish off damaged ships
- Don't rely on them against heavy armor

**Anti-Aircraft Batteries:**
- Use against aircraft, helicopters
- Some can engage small surface targets
- Automatic or manual control depending on settings
- Protect yourself and teammates

### 3.4 Shell Selection

**Against Destroyers:**
- SAP or HE often effective
- Aim for superstructure or exposed areas
- Torpedo tubes and magazines are weak points

**Against Light Cruisers:**
- SAP for penetration
- AP for citadel hits
- Mix based on range and angle

**Against Heavy Cruisers:**
- AP required for penetration
- Aim for belt armor or deck armor depending on range
- Long-range: plunging fire on deck
- Close range: belt armor

**Against Torpedo Boats:**
- HE for maximum damage
- Rapid-fire guns for tracking
- Don't waste large-caliber shells

## 4. Torpedo Warfare

### 4.1 Torpedo Basics

**Torpedo Characteristics:**
- Travel in straight lines (in most modes)
- Have arming distance (cannot detonate too close)
- Have maximum range
- Have speed and damage ratings

**Launch Angles:**
- Spread torpedoes to cover area
- Aim ahead of moving targets
- Account for target's speed and direction

### 4.2 Torpedo Employment

**Ambush Tactics:**
- Hide behind islands
- Launch when target is committed (cannot easily turn)
- Multiple torpedoes increase hit probability

**Brawling Range:**
- Close combat (1–2 km)
- Difficult for targets to dodge
- High risk to yourself

**Long-Range Torpedo Strikes:**
- Launch from maximum range
- Aim at slow or distracted targets
- Low hit probability but safe for you

**Area Denial:**
- Fire torpedoes into narrow channels
- Force enemies to slow down or avoid areas
- Complements gunnery by restricting movement

### 4.3 Countering Torpedoes

**Detection:**
- Watch for torpedo trails
- Use binoculars to spot torpedoes
- Listen for torpedo launch sounds
- Minimap may show torpedo markers

**Evasion:**
- Turn to present smallest profile
- Change speed (torpedoes are pre-aimed)
- Use islands to block torpedoes
- Angle ship to minimize impact area

**Prevention:**
- Maintain distance from torpedo boats
- Use secondary guns to destroy torpedo boats before launch
- Position to avoid torpedo launch angles

> **Warning:** One torpedo can cripple or destroy even heavy cruisers. Never ignore torpedo boat threats.

### 4.4 Torpedo Launch Checklist

1. **Target identification:** Confirm target is enemy and valid
2. **Range check:** Ensure target is within torpedo range
3. **Angle calculation:** Lead target appropriately
4. **Spread decision:** Single torpedo or spread?
5. **Timing:** Wait for optimal moment (target committed, can't dodge)
6. **Launch:** Fire torpedoes
7. **Post-launch:** Reposition, continue gunnery, or retreat
