# Heli Academy – Helicopter Combat Doctrine

Helicopters in War Thunder are unique. They combine the mobility of aircraft with the precision of ground vehicles. Mastering helicopters requires understanding their unique flight characteristics, weapon systems, and role on the battlefield.

## Introduction: The Helicopter Advantage

Helicopters offer unique capabilities that fixed-wing aircraft cannot match:
- Hovering for precise aiming
- Low-altitude flight using terrain masking
- Pop-up attacks from unexpected angles
- Long-range ATGM engagements

But they're also vulnerable:
- Slow compared to jets
- Vulnerable to SPAA
- Require skill to fly effectively
- Expensive in spawn points

This academy teaches you to leverage helicopter strengths while minimizing vulnerabilities.

> **Meta Insight:** Good helicopter pilots are patient and methodical. They use terrain and positioning to survive, then strike when opportunities arise. Rushing gets you killed.

## 1. Basics of Helicopter Controls

Helicopters control differently than fixed-wing aircraft. Understanding these differences is crucial.

### Flight Controls

**Collective**: Controls vertical movement (up/down). Increase collective to climb, decrease to descend.

**Cyclic**: Controls horizontal movement and attitude. Forward cyclic = forward movement, backward = backward, etc.

**Pedals**: Controls yaw (rotation). Essential for aiming and maneuvering.

**Coordination**: All three controls work together. Good helicopter pilots coordinate all inputs smoothly.

**The Learning Curve**: Helicopter controls are more complex than fixed-wing. Practice is essential. Don't expect to master them immediately.

### Hovering

Hovering is maintaining position in the air. It's useful for:
- Aiming ATGMs precisely
- Observing the battlefield
- Waiting for opportunities

**Practice**: Hovering requires constant micro-adjustments. Practice in test flight until you can maintain a stable hover.

**The Skill**: Good hovering requires fine control. You need to make constant small adjustments to maintain position. This takes practice.

### Forward Flight

Forward flight is faster and more fuel-efficient than hovering. Use it for:
- Traveling between positions
- Escaping threats
- Building speed for maneuvers

**Transition**: Learn to transition smoothly between hover and forward flight.

**The Efficiency**: Forward flight is more efficient than hovering. Use hovering only when necessary (aiming, observing). Use forward flight for travel.

## 2. Hovering, NOE Flight, and Pop-Up Attacks

These are the core helicopter tactics. Master these, and you'll be effective.

### Hovering

**When to Hover**:
- Aiming ATGMs at long range
- Observing enemy positions
- Waiting for targets
- Precise positioning

**When NOT to Hover**:
- Under enemy fire
- In SPAA range
- When aircraft are present
- In open areas

Hovering makes you vulnerable. Use it strategically, not constantly.

**The Balance**: Hovering is necessary for precise aiming, but it makes you vulnerable. Use it only when needed, and get moving as soon as possible.

### NOE (Nap-of-the-Earth) Flight

Flying very low, using terrain to mask your approach. This is how helicopters survive.

**Benefits**:
- Hard to spot
- Hard for SPAA to track
- Uses terrain as cover
- Surprise attacks

**Technique**:
- Fly as low as possible
- Follow terrain contours
- Use hills and valleys
- Stay below treetops when possible

**Practice**: NOE flight requires good control. Practice flying low and fast without crashing.

**The Survival Rule**: NOE flight is your primary survival technique. Stay low, use terrain, and you'll survive much longer.

### Pop-Up Attacks

The helicopter's signature attack method:

1. Approach low using NOE flight
2. Pop up to acquire target
3. Fire ATGMs or rockets
4. Immediately drop back down
5. Use terrain to escape

This minimizes exposure time while allowing accurate fire.

**The Timing**: Pop-up attacks require good timing. You need to pop up, acquire target, fire, and get back down quickly. Practice this sequence.

**The Exposure**: Minimize your exposure time. The longer you're visible, the more vulnerable you are. Quick pop-ups are safer than long hovers.

## 3. ATGM Usage and Limitations

Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) are your primary weapon against ground targets.

### ATGM Types

**Wire-Guided**: You control the missile's flight path. Requires maintaining line of sight and control input.

**Fire-and-Forget**: Lock on, fire, missile guides itself. More flexible but often shorter range.

**Laser-Guided**: Requires maintaining laser lock. More accurate but vulnerable to countermeasures.

**The Selection**: Different ATGM types have different advantages. Wire-guided gives you control but requires exposure. Fire-and-forget is safer but less flexible.

### Effective Range

ATGMs are most effective at medium to long range:
- Close range: You're vulnerable to return fire
- Medium range: Good balance of accuracy and safety
- Long range: Maximum safety but requires good aim

**Optimal Range**: 2-4 kilometers for most ATGMs. Far enough to be safe, close enough to be accurate.

**The Balance**: Too close, and you're vulnerable. Too far, and accuracy suffers. Find the sweet spot for your ATGMs.

### Limitations

**Line of Sight**: Most ATGMs require line of sight to target. Terrain can block them.

**Control Time**: Wire-guided ATGMs require you to guide them. This makes you vulnerable.

**Countermeasures**: Some vehicles have active protection systems that can intercept ATGMs.

**SPAA Threat**: SPAA can kill you while you're guiding missiles. Always be aware of SPAA.

**The Reality**: ATGMs are powerful but have limitations. Understand these limitations and work around them.

### Firing Techniques

**Hover and Fire**: Hover, aim precisely, fire, guide missile, drop down. Most accurate but most vulnerable.

**Moving and Fire**: Fire while moving, guide missile, continue moving. Less accurate but safer.

**Pop-Up Fire**: Pop up, fire quickly, drop down, guide from cover. Good balance of accuracy and safety.

**The Selection**: Choose firing technique based on situation. If SPAA is present, use pop-up fire. If safe, hover and fire for accuracy.

## 4. Avoiding SPAA and Jets

Survival is your primary concern. SPAA and jets are your biggest threats.

### SPAA Avoidance

**Stay Low**: SPAA has trouble tracking low-flying targets. Use NOE flight.

**Use Terrain**: Hills, buildings, and terrain features block SPAA line of sight.

**Pop-Up Attacks**: Minimize exposure time. Pop up, fire, drop down immediately.

**Watch for Tracers**: SPAA tracers show you where threats are. Avoid those areas.

**Don't Hover in SPAA Range**: If SPAA is present, don't hover. Keep moving, stay low.

**The Rule**: If SPAA can see you, it can kill you. Stay low, use terrain, minimize exposure.

### Jet Avoidance

**Stay Low**: Jets have trouble engaging low-flying helicopters. Use terrain masking.

**Use Terrain**: Terrain blocks jet line of sight and makes attacks difficult.

**Watch the Sky**: Constantly check for aircraft. If you see a jet, get low immediately.

**Don't Climb**: Climbing makes you an easy target for jets. Stay low.

**Escape Routes**: Always have an escape route planned. Know where you can hide.

**The Reality**: Jets are fast and dangerous. Your best defense is staying low and using terrain.

### General Survival Rules

1. **Assume Threats Exist**: Even if you don't see SPAA or jets, assume they're there.
2. **Stay Low**: Low altitude is your friend. Use it.
3. **Use Terrain**: Terrain is your cover. Use it constantly.
4. **Keep Moving**: Stationary helicopters are dead helicopters.
5. **Have Escape Routes**: Always know where you can hide.

**The Mindset**: Survival first, kills second. A dead helicopter contributes nothing. Stay alive, and opportunities will come.

## 5. When to Spawn, and When Not To

Helicopters are expensive in Spawn Points. Spawn wisely.

### Good Times to Spawn

- Enemy has multiple tanks in the open
- Your team needs air support
- Enemy SPAA is eliminated or distracted
- You have enough SP for a good helicopter
- Battle situation favors helicopters

**The Decision**: Spawning a helicopter is a significant investment. Make sure the situation warrants it.

### Bad Times to Spawn

- Enemy has strong SPAA coverage
- Enemy has aircraft up
- You don't have enough SP
- Battle is almost over
- You're not confident in your helicopter skills

**The Restraint**: Sometimes the best decision is not to spawn. Don't waste SP on bad situations.

### SP Management

Helicopters cost significant SP. Consider:
- Can you contribute meaningfully?
- Is the battle situation favorable?
- Do you have enough SP for multiple spawns if needed?
- Is your helicopter appropriate for the BR?

**Rule**: Don't spawn a helicopter just because you can. Spawn when you can contribute.

**The Economics**: Helicopters are expensive. Make sure you can earn back your SP investment through effective gameplay.

## 6. Rocket vs Gun Runs

Helicopters can use rockets and guns in addition to ATGMs. Understanding when to use each is important.

### Rocket Runs

**When to Use**:
- Multiple targets
- Light vehicles
- Finishing damaged targets
- Area suppression

**How to Use**:
- Approach low
- Pop up to fire
- Drop back down
- Use terrain to escape

**The Technique**: Rocket runs require good aim and timing. Practice in test flight and custom battles.

### Gun Runs

**When to Use**:
- Light vehicles
- Finishing damaged targets
- When out of ATGMs
- Close-range engagements

**How to Use**:
- Approach low
- Pop up to fire
- Drop back down
- Use terrain to escape

**The Technique**: Gun runs are similar to rocket runs but require more precision. Practice leading targets.

## 7. Drone & Heli Synergy

At high tier, drones and helicopters can work together effectively.

### Drone Spotting

Drones can spot targets for helicopters:
- Drones spot enemies
- Helicopters engage from safe positions
- Combined effectiveness

**The Coordination**: Drones and helicopters complement each other. Drones provide spotting, helicopters provide firepower.

### Combined Operations

Helicopters and drones working together:
- Drones spot and mark targets
- Helicopters engage from range
- Combined area denial

**The Tactics**: Use drones to spot, then engage with helicopters. This maximizes effectiveness while minimizing risk.
