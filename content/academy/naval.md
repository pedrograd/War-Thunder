# Naval Academy – Ship Combat Doctrine

Naval combat in War Thunder is about positioning, gunnery, and understanding ship roles. Each ship class has a specific job, and success comes from playing to your strengths while exploiting enemy weaknesses.

## Introduction: The Naval Battlefield

Naval combat in War Thunder is fundamentally different from ground or air combat. It's slower, more methodical, and requires understanding of:
- Ship classes and their roles
- Gunnery and shell ballistics
- Torpedo tactics
- Map positioning
- Team coordination

This academy teaches you to master these elements and become an effective naval commander.

> **Meta Insight:** Good naval players are patient and methodical. They understand positioning, gunnery, and ship roles. Rushing gets you killed in naval combat.

**The Tactics**: Cruisers are anchors. Use them to hold positions, provide long-range fire, and support the team.

## 2. Gunnery and Target Leading

Naval gunnery is about leading targets and managing shell travel time.

### Leading Targets

Ships move, shells take time to travel. You must lead your target.

**Factors**:
- Target speed
- Target direction
- Range
- Shell velocity
- Your movement

**Practice**: Start with too much lead, then reduce. It's better to lead too much than too little.

**The Learning Process**: Leading is learned through practice. Every ship and situation is different. Practice consistently to improve.

### Shell Types

**AP (Armor-Piercing)**: Good against armored targets. Penetrates and causes internal damage.

**HE (High-Explosive)**: Good against unarmored targets. Causes fires and module damage.

**SAP (Semi-Armor-Piercing)**: Balance between AP and HE. Good general-purpose round.

**Choose Based On**:
- Target type (armored vs unarmored)
- Target angle
- Desired effect (penetration vs fire)

**The Selection**: Different shell types for different situations. Learn when to use each type.

### Range Estimation

Knowing range helps with leading and shell selection.

**Methods**:
- Use rangefinder (if available)
- Estimate based on target size
- Use minimap distance
- Practice and experience

**Practice**: Estimate range before checking. This builds your range estimation skills.

**The Skill**: Good range estimation improves accuracy. Practice estimating range, then check your estimate.

## 3. Torpedoes and Anti-Torpedo Behavior

Torpedoes are powerful but require good positioning and timing.

### Torpedo Usage

**Effective Range**: Torpedoes are most effective at medium range. Too close = enemy can dodge. Too far = long travel time.

**Launch Angles**: 
- Broadside launches = best chance to hit
- Bow/stern launches = easier to dodge
- Multiple spreads = harder to dodge

**Timing**: Launch when enemy is committed to a course. Predict their movement.

**The Tactics**: Torpedoes require good timing and positioning. Launch when enemies are committed to a course, not when they can easily dodge.

### Avoiding Torpedoes

**Watch for Launches**: Torpedo launches are visible. Watch for them.

**Change Course**: When torpedoes are incoming, change course immediately. Don't wait.

**Speed Management**: Sometimes slowing down helps dodge. Sometimes speeding up helps. Depends on situation.

**Angle**: Angling can help torpedoes pass by without hitting.

**Practice**: Learn to spot torpedo launches and react quickly.

**The Awareness**: Good players watch for torpedo launches and react immediately. Don't wait until torpedoes are close.

## 4. Using Islands and Cover

Islands provide cover and tactical advantages. Use them effectively.

### Cover Usage

**Blocking Line of Sight**: Islands block enemy vision. Use them to approach unseen.

**Breaking Contact**: Islands let you break contact and reposition.

**Ambush Positions**: Islands provide cover for ambush attacks.

**Protection**: Islands can block incoming fire (depending on angle).

**The Tactics**: Islands are your primary cover in naval combat. Use them to block line of sight, break contact, and set up ambushes.

### Positioning Around Islands

**Behind Islands**: Use islands to mask your approach.

**Between Islands**: Use gaps between islands for firing positions.

**Around Islands**: Use islands to break line of sight and reposition.

**Practice**: Learn which islands provide good cover on each map.

**The Knowledge**: Map knowledge is crucial. Know which islands provide good cover and which don't.

## 5. AA vs Aircraft

Aircraft are a threat to ships. Your AA guns are your defense.

### AA Effectiveness

**Range**: AA has limited range. Aircraft outside range are safe.

**Accuracy**: AA accuracy varies. Some ships have good AA, others don't.

**Coverage**: AA coverage varies by angle. Some angles have better coverage than others.

**The Reality**: AA effectiveness varies by ship. Some ships have excellent AA, others have poor AA. Know your ship's AA capabilities.

### Positioning for AA

**Group Up**: Multiple ships together have better AA coverage.

**Angle Your Ship**: Some angles provide better AA coverage.

**Use Islands**: Islands can block aircraft approach angles.

**Watch the Sky**: Constantly check for aircraft. Early warning helps.

**The Tactics**: Position to maximize AA effectiveness. Group with teammates, angle your ship, use islands to block approaches.

### Surviving Aircraft Attacks

**Change Course**: Moving targets are harder to hit.

**Use AA**: Your AA can damage or destroy aircraft. Use it.

**Seek Cover**: Islands can block aircraft line of sight.

**Group Up**: Multiple ships together are harder for aircraft to attack.

**The Survival**: Aircraft are dangerous. Use AA, change course, seek cover, and group with teammates.
