# Ground Tactics Academy – Tank Warfare Doctrine

Tank combat in War Thunder is about understanding armor, positioning, and timing. This guide covers the fundamental principles that apply at every Battle Rating, from low-tier brawls to top-tier modern warfare.

## Introduction: What Makes a Great Tanker?

Many players assume that success in War Thunder comes from having the best vehicles or the highest penetration shells. While these help, they're not what separates good players from great ones.

**Great tankers understand:**
- How to read the battlefield and predict enemy movements
- When to push and when to hold
- How to position themselves to maximize advantages
- How to work with teammates to create opportunities
- How to adapt their playstyle to different situations

This academy teaches these principles. We focus on concepts that remain true regardless of balance changes, patch updates, or vehicle additions. Master these fundamentals, and you'll succeed at any BR.

> **Meta Insight:** The best players don't just know what to do—they understand why it works. This understanding lets them adapt to new situations and counter unexpected strategies.

## 1. Armor & Angling Science

Armor effectiveness isn't just about thickness—it's about how that armor is presented to incoming fire. Understanding the science behind armor angling is fundamental to tank combat.

### Effective Thickness Concept

When armor is angled, it becomes effectively thicker. A plate angled at 45 degrees presents approximately 1.4x more material to penetrate than the same plate facing straight on. At 60 degrees, it's approximately 2x thicker. This is why angling is crucial.

**The Physics**: When a shell hits angled armor, it must travel through more material. The steeper the angle, the more material the shell must penetrate.

**The Practical Application**: Angling your armor correctly can turn a penetrable shot into a bounce. This is the difference between life and death in many engagements.

### Front vs Side vs Turret Armor

**Frontal Armor**: Usually the strongest. Designed to face the enemy. But it often has weakspots:
- Lower front plate (LFP): Almost always weaker than upper front plate
- Driver ports: Small weakspots requiring precision
- Machine gun ports: Small weakspots, often vulnerable
- Gun mantlet gaps: Around the gun barrel, gaps in armor

**Side Armor**: Weaker than front, but can be angled to increase effectiveness. Side shots are usually lethal because:
- Side armor is thinner
- Side shots often hit ammo racks
- Side shots can hit multiple crew members

**Turret Armor**: Varies wildly. Some tanks have strong turrets, others have weak ones. Turret rings are almost always vulnerable—the gap between turret and hull.

**Rear Armor**: Almost always weak. Rear shots are almost always lethal because:
- Rear armor is thinnest
- Rear shots hit engine and fuel tanks
- Rear shots often cause fires

### Angling Basics

The goal is to present your strongest armor at an angle that makes it harder to penetrate while hiding your weakspots.

```
Simple Angling Diagram:

    Enemy
      |
      v
    [  \  ]  <- Angled tank (harder to penetrate)
     \  /
      \/

vs

    Enemy
      |
      v
    [  |  ]  <- Flat tank (easy to penetrate)
     |  |
     |  |
```

**When Angling Helps**:
- You have strong side armor
- Enemy is firing from the front
- You're in a defensive position
- You have time to position correctly

**When Angling Hurts**:
- Your side armor is very weak
- Multiple enemies are firing from different angles
- You expose critical weakspots (ammo racks, crew)
- You're in a mobile engagement

### The "Diamond" Position

For many tanks, the optimal angle is around 30-45 degrees. This creates a "diamond" shape that's harder to penetrate from the front while not exposing too much side armor.

**Finding Your Optimal Angle**:
1. Test in protection analysis tool
2. Find angle where effective armor is highest
3. Ensure you're not exposing side weakspots
4. Practice maintaining this angle in combat

**Example Scenario**: You're in a 5.7 heavy tank facing an enemy medium tank head-on. Instead of facing them directly, you angle your hull 35 degrees. This increases your effective armor thickness while keeping your side armor relatively protected. The enemy's shot bounces, and you have time to aim for their weakspot.

> **Pro Tip:** Test your optimal angling in the protection analysis tool. Find the angle where your effective armor is highest without exposing critical weakspots. This angle becomes your default when facing enemies head-on.

### Overmatching – When Angling Fails

**What Overmatching Is**: When a shell's caliber is significantly larger than the armor thickness, angling becomes less effective. A very large shell can penetrate angled armor that would bounce smaller shells.

**The Rule of Thumb**: If shell caliber is 3x or more the armor thickness, overmatching occurs. Angling helps less in these situations.

**Practical Application**: Don't rely on angling against very large guns. Use positioning and cover instead.

> **Warning:** Angling isn't magic. Very large shells can still penetrate angled armor. Use angling as one tool in your toolkit, not your only defense.

## 2. Weakspot Mastery

Every vehicle has weakspots. Learning them is essential for effective combat. The difference between a good player and a great player often comes down to weakspot knowledge and aiming precision.

**Why Weakspots Matter**: Hitting a weakspot can turn an impossible shot into a kill. A moderate-penetration gun might not penetrate a heavy tank's front plate, but it can easily penetrate the lower front plate or turret ring. This knowledge is what separates effective players from those who bounce shots.

### Typical Weakspot Locations

**Lower Front Plate (LFP)**: Almost always weaker than the upper front plate. Often a good target, especially at range where it's easier to hit.

**Turret Ring**: The gap between turret and hull. Usually vulnerable. Hard to hit at range, but very effective if hit.

**Gun Mantlet Gaps**: Around the gun barrel, there are often gaps in the armor. Skilled players can hit these, disabling the gun.

**Driver Ports / Vision Ports**: Small weakspots on the front. Require precision but are often effective.

**Machine Gun Ports**: Small weakspots, usually on the front. Can be effective if hit.

**Ammo Racks**: Locations vary by vehicle. Hitting these can cause instant destruction. Learn common locations:
- Side of hull (common on many vehicles)
- Floor of hull (some vehicles)
- Rear of turret (some vehicles)

**Crew Compartments**: Hitting crew members disables functions:
- Gunner hit = can't shoot
- Driver hit = can't move
- Loader hit = slower reload
- Commander hit = reduced awareness

### Aim for Modules First

The best approach: disable the enemy's ability to fight, then kill them.

**The Sequence**:
1. **Gun First**: If you can't kill them immediately, disable their gun. Hit the gun barrel or breech.
2. **Tracks Second**: Immobilize them. A stationary target is easier to finish.
3. **Then Kill**: Once disabled, take your time to aim for crew or ammo.

This approach is safer and more reliable than going for instant kills.

**Example Scenario**: You're in a 4.7 medium tank facing a 5.7 heavy tank. You know you can't penetrate their front armor reliably. Instead of bouncing shots, you:
1. First shot: Aim for their gun barrel, disabling their ability to fire
2. Second shot: Track them, preventing escape
3. Third shot: Move to their side and aim for ammo rack or crew

This three-shot sequence is more reliable than trying to find a front weakspot under pressure.

> **Drill:** Practice the "disable then kill" sequence in test drive. Load a heavily armored target, disable their gun, then track them, then finish them. Repeat until this sequence becomes automatic.

### Weakspot Patterns by Vehicle Type

**Heavy Tanks**: Usually strong frontal armor, but weakspots exist:
- Lower front plate
- Turret ring
- Sometimes weak turret cheeks
- Side armor (if you can get angle)

**Medium Tanks**: More balanced, but still have weakspots:
- Lower front plate
- Turret ring
- Sometimes weak turret armor
- Side armor

**Light Tanks**: Generally weak armor, but still have stronger and weaker areas:
- Frontal armor (if any) is usually weak
- Side and rear are very weak
- Sometimes have strong turret (rare)

**Tank Destroyers**: Vary wildly, but common patterns:
- Often weak side armor
- Sometimes weak lower front plate
- Gun mantlet can be strong or weak (varies)

> **Meta Insight:** Learning weakspots is an ongoing process. Every new vehicle you face teaches you something. Build a mental library of weakspots through experience.

## 3. Vehicle Roles & Playstyles

Understanding vehicle roles helps you play to your strengths and support your team. Each role has specific jobs, strengths, and weaknesses. Playing a vehicle according to its role maximizes effectiveness.

**Common Mistake**: Many players try to make every vehicle do everything. A light tank shouldn't brawl with heavies. A heavy tank shouldn't try to flank like a light. Play to your vehicle's strengths, not against them.

### Light Tanks

**Playstyle**: Fast, agile, scouting-focused. Flank enemies, spot for team, capture objectives.

**Best Map Types**: Maps with cover, multiple routes, opportunities for flanking.

**Things to Avoid**: Head-on engagements with heavies, open ground without cover, staying in one position too long.

**Team Value**: Scouting enemies, capturing objectives, flanking threats, providing mobile firepower.

**Key Skills**: Map knowledge, route planning, scouting timing, escape routes.

**Example Scenario**: You're in a 6.7 light tank on an urban map. Instead of pushing the main street with the heavies, you:
1. Take a side route to flank
2. Scout enemies for your team (marking them on minimap)
3. Wait for an opportunity to attack from the side
4. After engaging, immediately relocate to avoid return fire

This playstyle leverages your speed and scouting ability while avoiding your weakness (armor).

> **Counterplay Tip:** When facing light tanks, watch your flanks constantly. They excel at attacking from unexpected angles. Position yourself to cover multiple approaches, and use your heavier armor to survive their initial attack while you return fire.

### Medium Tanks

**Playstyle**: Versatile. Can brawl, flank, snipe, or support depending on situation.

**Best Map Types**: All map types. Mediums are adaptable.

**Things to Avoid**: Overcommitting to one role, ignoring your mobility advantage, fighting heavies frontally without advantage.

**Team Value**: Flexible response to threats, holding key positions, supporting pushes, filling gaps.

**Key Skills**: Situational awareness, role switching, positioning, target prioritization.

**The Versatility Advantage**: Medium tanks can adapt to any situation. A good medium tank player reads the battle and fills whatever role is needed.

### Heavy Tanks

**Playstyle**: Slow but powerful. Anchor positions, spearhead pushes, absorb damage.

**Best Map Types**: Maps with chokepoints, defensive positions, areas where armor matters.

**Things to Avoid**: Getting flanked, open engagements without cover, overextending alone.

**Team Value**: Holding key positions, leading pushes, drawing enemy fire, providing firepower.

**Key Skills**: Positioning, angling, patience, reading enemy movements.

**The Anchor Role**: Heavy tanks anchor team positions. They hold key areas, allowing lighter vehicles to maneuver. A good heavy tank player creates space for teammates.

### Tank Destroyers

**Playstyle**: High firepower, often no turret. Ambush enemies, snipe from distance, hold angles.

**Best Map Types**: Maps with long sightlines, defensive positions, ambush opportunities.

**Things to Avoid**: Close combat, getting flanked, exposing weak armor, overextending.

**Team Value**: Long-range firepower, area denial, ambushing threats, supporting from distance.

**Key Skills**: Positioning, patience, map knowledge, aiming precision.

**The Ambush Specialist**: Tank destroyers excel at ambushing. They position themselves to catch enemies off-guard, using their powerful guns to eliminate threats quickly.

### SPAA (Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft)

**Playstyle**: Primary role is killing aircraft. Secondary role is killing light vehicles.

**Best Map Types**: Any map where aircraft are present. Open maps favor SPAA.

**Things to Avoid**: Engaging heavy tanks, exposing yourself to ground fire, staying in obvious positions.

**Team Value**: Air defense, light vehicle elimination, sometimes scouting.

**Key Skills**: Leading aircraft, positioning for air defense, knowing when to engage ground targets.

**The Air Defense Role**: SPAA protects the team from aircraft. Good SPAA players eliminate aircraft threats, allowing ground forces to operate safely.

## 4. Micro Tactics – Winning Individual Engagements

Small-scale tactics that win individual engagements. These are the building blocks of effective combat. Master these, and you'll win more 1v1 fights. Combine them, and you'll dominate matches.

**The Foundation**: All micro tactics rely on the same principles: minimize your exposure, maximize enemy exposure, control the engagement timing, and always have an escape plan.

### Peeking and Shoulder-Peeking

**Peeking**: Exposing just enough of your vehicle to shoot, then retreating. Minimizes exposure time.

**Shoulder-Peeking**: Exposing your turret from behind cover, shooting, then retreating. Very safe but limited firing angles.

**Example Scenario**: You're behind a building corner, and an enemy is watching your position. 

- **Shoulder-peek**: Expose only your turret, fire, immediately pull back. Very safe, but you can only shoot at targets directly in front of you.
- **Peek**: Expose more of your hull to get a better angle, fire, immediately reverse back. More dangerous, but allows you to engage targets at wider angles.

Practice both. Shoulder-peeking is safer but peeking gives better angles. Use shoulder-peeking when you're unsure of enemy positions. Use peeking when you need better angles or when you're confident about enemy locations.

> **Warning:** Never peek the same spot twice in a row. After you shoot, enemies will be aiming at that exact position. Vary your peeking location, or wait before peeking again.

### Shoot-and-Scoot

After firing, immediately move. Don't stay in the same position. Enemies will aim at where you just shot from.

**The Sequence**: Aim → Fire → Immediately reverse or move to new position.

**Why It Works**: Enemies aim at where you were, not where you are. Moving immediately makes you harder to hit.

**Practice**: Make this automatic. Fire, then move. Don't wait to see if your shot hit—move first, check results later.

### Using Reverse Gear

Many players forget reverse exists. Use it to:
- Back into cover after shooting
- Retreat from bad positions
- Maintain angling while moving
- Escape dangerous situations

**The Reverse Advantage**: Many vehicles have decent reverse speed. Use it to escape while maintaining your gun on target.

**Practice**: Reversing is a crucial survival skill. Practice backing around corners, reversing into cover, using reverse to escape.

### Borrowing Cover from Dead Tanks

Destroyed vehicles provide cover. Use them as:
- Shooting positions
- Cover while repairing
- Obstacles to block enemy fire
- Reference points for positioning

**The Tactical Use**: Dead tanks are mobile cover. Position yourself behind them, use them to block shots, use them to mask your approach.

### Repair Positioning

When you need to repair, position yourself:
- Behind solid cover
- At an angle that protects your weakspots
- Where you can see threats approaching
- With an escape route available

Never repair in the open. Never repair facing the enemy directly.

**The Repair Sequence**: 
1. Get to cover
2. Position defensively
3. Start repair
4. Watch for threats
5. Be ready to cancel repair and escape if needed

## 5. Macro Tactics – Winning Matches

Large-scale tactics that win matches. While micro tactics win individual engagements, macro tactics win entire battles. These are the strategic decisions that determine match outcomes.

**The Key Difference**: Micro tactics are about "how to win this fight." Macro tactics are about "how to win this match." Great players excel at both.

### Lane Theory

Maps have "lanes"—routes vehicles typically take. Understanding lanes helps you:
- Predict enemy movements
- Position to control key lanes
- Identify which lanes need support
- Flank through unguarded lanes

**Example Scenario**: On a typical three-lane map, you notice:
- Left lane: Your team has 2 players, enemy has 3. This lane is contested.
- Center lane: Your team has 4 players, enemy has 1. This lane is controlled.
- Right lane: Your team has 1 player, enemy has 2. This lane is collapsing.

**Macro Decision**: Instead of reinforcing the collapsing right lane (which might be too late), you rotate to support the contested left lane. This helps secure that lane, then you can push from left to right, flanking the enemies in the right lane.

Learn the lanes on each map. Control key lanes, and you control the map.

> **Meta Insight:** Lane control is about understanding where enemies will be and positioning to counter them. Good players read lane status and make decisions based on it.

### Crossfires

Positioning multiple vehicles to fire at the same area from different angles. Creates a kill zone enemies can't escape.

**Example Scenario**: You and a teammate are approaching an enemy position. Instead of both attacking from the same angle:
- You position on the left side of the enemy
- Your teammate positions on the right side
- When the enemy engages one of you, the other has a clear side shot

This crossfire makes it impossible for the enemy to angle against both of you simultaneously. They're forced to choose which threat to face, and the other gets a free shot.

Setting up crossfires requires:
- Communication (or reading teammate positions)
- Map knowledge
- Patience
- Good positioning

> **Drill:** Practice reading teammate positions and setting up crossfires. Even without communication, you can position yourself to create crossfires with teammates. Watch where they are, and position yourself at a different angle to the same target.

### Rotating to Collapsing Flanks

When one flank is collapsing (teammates dying, enemies advancing), you have options:
- Reinforce the collapsing flank
- Rotate to a stronger position
- Counter-attack from another angle

Good players read these situations and respond appropriately. Don't just charge into a losing fight.

**The Decision Framework**:
1. Can you save the collapsing flank? (If yes, reinforce. If no, rotate.)
2. Is there a better position to hold? (If yes, rotate there.)
3. Can you counter-attack from another angle? (If yes, do that.)

### Reading Killfeed and Minimap

**Killfeed**: Shows who's dying and where. Tells you:
- Which areas are contested
- What vehicle types are active
- When enemies are eliminated
- Battle momentum

**Minimap**: Shows team positions, objectives, sometimes enemy markers. Tells you:
- Where teammates are
- Where gaps exist
- Where enemies might be
- Objective status

Check both constantly. They provide crucial battlefield intelligence.

**The Information Advantage**: Players who read killfeed and minimap effectively make better decisions. They know where threats are, where opportunities exist, and how the battle is developing.

## 6. High-Tier Meta – Modern Warfare Tactics

High-tier gameplay (8.0+) introduces new mechanics that change how you play. Understanding these is essential for success at high BRs.

### Stabilizer Meta

**What Stabilizers Do**: Allow firing accurately while moving. Single-axis stabilizers work forward/backward. Dual-axis stabilizers work in all directions.

**How It Changes Gameplay**: 
- You can fire while repositioning
- Moving shots become viable
- Aggressive play becomes more effective
- You don't need to stop to aim

**The Tactical Advantage**: Vehicles with stabilizers can engage while moving. This is a massive advantage over vehicles without stabilizers.

**How to Use Stabilizers**:
- Fire while moving to new positions
- Use movement to make yourself harder to hit
- Don't stop unnecessarily—keep moving
- Use stabilizers for snap shots

> **Meta Insight:** At high tier, stabilizers are standard. Vehicles without stabilizers are at a significant disadvantage. Use your stabilizer advantage aggressively.

### Thermal Imaging

**What Thermals Do**: Allow you to see heat signatures through smoke, foliage, and some cover.

**How It Changes Gameplay**:
- Target detection becomes easier
- You can spot enemies through concealment
- Night battles become daytime battles
- Positioning becomes more important (you're more visible)

**The Tactical Advantage**: Thermal imaging is game-changing. It makes target detection trivial and changes how you position.

**How to Counter Thermals**:
- Use terrain to break line of sight
- Don't rely on smoke (thermals see through it)
- Position where thermals can't see you
- Use cover that blocks thermal vision

### Modern MBT Triangle

At high tier, MBTs balance three characteristics:
- **Firepower**: Gun penetration and damage
- **Mobility**: Speed and agility
- **Optics**: Thermal imaging and rangefinders

**The Triangle**: Most MBTs excel in 1-2 areas but are weaker in others. Understanding your vehicle's strengths and weaknesses is crucial.

**Example**: A fast MBT with good optics but weak armor should use mobility and optics, not try to brawl. A well-armored MBT with good firepower but slow speed should use positioning and firepower, not try to be mobile.

### IFV and Drone Influence

**IFVs (Infantry Fighting Vehicles)**: Fast, well-armed vehicles that excel at scouting and flanking. They're common at high tier and can be very dangerous.

**Drones**: Unmanned aircraft that can spot and attack. They add a new dimension to high-tier gameplay.

**How to Deal With**:
- Watch for IFV flanks constantly
- Use SPAA against drones
- Don't ignore light vehicles—they're dangerous
- Position to cover multiple angles

> **Warning:** At high tier, light vehicles are more dangerous than at low tier. They have powerful guns and can kill MBTs easily. Don't ignore them.

### CAS Escalation

At high tier, CAS (Close Air Support) becomes more lethal. Smart bombs, guided missiles, and advanced aircraft make CAS very dangerous.

**How to Survive**:
- Always have SPAA in your lineup
- Use terrain masking
- Don't stay in open areas
- Position near cover

**The SPAA Role**: SPAA is essential at high tier. Good SPAA players protect the team from aircraft threats.

## 7. Smoke Usage

Smoke is a powerful tactical tool when used correctly. Many players ignore it or use it poorly.

### When to Use Smoke

**Offensive Smoke**:
- Mask your advance
- Block enemy sightlines
- Create opportunities to push

**Defensive Smoke**:
- Cover your retreat
- Block enemy fire
- Give yourself time to repair

**Tactical Smoke**:
- Force enemies to reposition
- Create confusion
- Block key sightlines

### How to Use Smoke Effectively

**Positioning**: Place smoke between you and enemies, not on yourself. Smoke on yourself makes you blind too.

**Timing**: Use smoke before you need it, not after you're already under fire.

**Combination**: Combine smoke with movement. Don't just sit in smoke—use it to reposition.

> **Warning:** Remember that thermal imaging sees through smoke. At high tier, smoke is less effective because of thermals. Use terrain masking instead.

## 8. Fighting When Up-Tiered

You'll be up-tiered more often than down-tiered. Learning to fight at a disadvantage is crucial.

### The Up-Tier Reality

**What It Means**: You're facing vehicles 0.7-1.0 BR higher than yours. They have better armor, better guns, better mobility.

**The Mindset**: Don't give up. You can still contribute. You just need to play differently.

### How to Fight Up-Tiered

**Support Role**: 
- Scout enemies for stronger teammates
- Capture objectives
- Support pushes
- Don't try to carry

**Target Selection**: 
- Focus on weaker enemies (light tanks, SPAA)
- Avoid head-on fights with stronger vehicles
- Use positioning to overcome disadvantages

**Positioning**: 
- Use terrain to your advantage
- Engage from angles where your gun can penetrate
- Don't fight fair—use every advantage you can

**Patience**: 
- Wait for opportunities
- Don't rush into bad fights
- Let stronger teammates engage first

> **Pro Tip:** When up-tiered, your role changes. You're not the main fighter—you're support. Embrace that role and contribute to team victory.

## 9. Common Mistakes

Avoid these mistakes that get players killed:

1. **Over-Pushing Alone**: Pushing without support gets you killed. Always move with teammates or have a plan.

2. **Sitting in the Open After Firing**: After you shoot, move. Don't stay exposed.

3. **Ignoring SPAA and CAS**: Aircraft will kill you if you ignore them. Always be aware of air threats.

4. **Not Watching Flanks**: Tunnel vision kills. Constantly check your flanks.

5. **Poor Ammo Management**: Carrying full ammo loads increases explosion risk. Carry 20-30 rounds for most tanks.

6. **Fighting at a Disadvantage**: If you're damaged, outnumbered, or outpositioned, retreat. Don't fight losing battles.

7. **Wasting Spawn Points**: Don't spawn into bad situations. Save SP for good opportunities.

8. **Ignoring Objectives**: Kills don't win matches. Objectives do. Play the objectives.

9. **Not Using Cover**: Open ground is death. Always move between cover points.

10. **Peeking the Same Spot Twice**: If you shot from somewhere, enemies are watching it. Vary your position.

11. **Poor Angle Management**: Not angling when you should, or angling when you shouldn't. Learn when to angle.

12. **Ignoring Audio Cues**: Engine sounds, gunfire, explosions—all tell you where enemies are. Use your ears.

## 10. Ground Tactics Drills

Practice these drills to build skills:

> **Drill: Angling Practice**  
> In test drive, position your tank at different angles. Note which angles bounce shots. Find the optimal angle for your vehicles. Practice maintaining this angle while moving.

> **Drill: Weakspot Targeting**  
> Load test drive with common enemy vehicles. Practice hitting weakspots from different angles and ranges. Focus on consistency, not speed initially.

> **Drill: Peek and Retreat**  
> In custom battles, practice peeking, shooting, and immediately retreating. Time your exposure. Practice until you can peek and retreat in under 2 seconds.

> **Drill: Reverse Gear Mastery**  
> Practice reversing around corners, backing into cover, using reverse to escape. Many players never use reverse—master it.

> **Drill: Multi-Angle Engagement**  
> Practice engaging enemies from different angles. Learn to adjust your aim and positioning based on engagement angle.

> **Drill: Cover Movement**  
> Practice moving between cover points efficiently. Plan routes before moving. Minimize time in the open.

> **Drill: Module Targeting**  
> Practice disabling enemy modules: gun first, then tracks, then kill. This is safer than going for instant kills.

> **Drill: Minimap Reading**  
> Set a timer for every 5 seconds. When it beeps, check minimap and identify: teammate positions, gaps, potential threats. Do this for entire battles.

> **Drill: Lane Control**  
> Focus entire battles on controlling specific map lanes. Learn which lanes are important, how to control them, when to abandon them.

> **Drill: Crossfire Setup**  
> Practice positioning to create crossfires with teammates. Learn to read teammate positions and set up kill zones.

## Conclusion

Ground combat mastery comes from understanding fundamentals and practicing them consistently. Focus on armor mechanics, positioning, and team play. These skills apply at every BR.

Remember: Good positioning beats good aim. Smart play beats aggressive play. Team contribution beats individual performance.

Good luck on the battlefield, commander.
