# Air Academy – Fighter & CAS Doctrine

## 1. Mission of the Air Academy
The Air Academy is the core War Thunder flight school for both fighter pilots and ground-attack specialists. It is written for players who already understand basic controls and want a disciplined doctrine that scales from reserve props to supersonic jets. Every concept is framed around realistic battle pacing, with emphasis on Air RB duels and Close Air Support (CAS) for Ground RB. The manual functions as a living doctrine—expect to re-read sections as you unlock new battle ratings (BRs) or when major patches alter aircraft performance.

- **Air RB focus:** mastering energy control, position play, and the single-pass mentality required to survive larger maps, sparse spotting, and compressed time-to-kill.
- **Ground RB CAS focus:** launching precise, survivable strike sorties that complement tank lineups without donating aircraft to the enemy team.
- **Training philosophy:** build repeatable checklists for pre-flight, ingress, attack, and egress so that muscle memory handles routine tasks while your mind stays free to interpret the fight.

The module links to other pillars of the War Thunder curriculum:

- **New Player Path:** builds on controller setup and camera discipline learned in the basic tutorial. This manual assumes you can already take off, land, and bind key functions.
- **Ground Academy:** CAS doctrine must mirror ground tempo. Knowing armor matchups, capture timings, and SPAA threats lets you deliver ordnance when teammates actually need it.
- **Nation Guides:** apply this doctrine to specific national tech trees, understanding which aircraft excel at boom-and-zoom (BnZ), turn fights, or ordnance delivery.
- **Meta Hub:** monitors and updates tier-by-tier aircraft performance, informing which planes deserve lineup slots for grinding, events, or competitive play.
- **Economy Lab:** helps evaluate silver lion (SL) upkeep, repair costs, and booster usage so that practicing air combat remains financially sustainable.

Completing the Air Academy means you can deliberately choose altitude, approach angles, ammunition usage, and mission timing instead of reacting randomly to the battle feed. Graduates should be able to brief a wingman, articulate a plan, and adapt when the lobby throws unexpected matchups or weather.

> **Pro Tip (Air):** Treat this manual like a syllabus. Focus on one chapter per week, log your findings, and only move forward once you can teach the concept to another pilot. Teaching cements mastery.

## 2. Fundamentals of Air Combat in War Thunder
War Thunder’s flight model simulates aircraft in three-dimensional space with accelerated time-to-target. Thinking only in flat turns leads to stalled engines, overheat, and predictable paths. Build habits around the following fundamentals.

### 2.1 3D Movement vs 2D Thinking
Your aircraft lives in a sphere of possible trajectories. Opponents who climb or dive outside your horizontal tunnel break radar awareness instantly. Visualize every fight as stacked layers:

- **Horizontal plane (2D):** headings, map routes, runway alignments.
- **Vertical plane (3D):** altitude ladders, loops, and roll/pitch transitions that decide who owns potential energy.
- **Combined vectors:** rolling into a bank and pitching simultaneously produces oblique lifts that most beginners ignore.
- **Axis prioritization:** decide if the upcoming maneuver needs pitch-first (vertical) or roll-first (horizontal) input. Applying both simultaneously without intent simply wastes energy.

[VECTOR ARROWS: Vertical vs horizontal maneuver paths]

### 2.2 Energy = Altitude + Speed
Energy dictates who dictates the fight. Potential energy (altitude) converts into kinetic energy (speed) through gravity; kinetic converts back when you pitch up and trade airspeed for altitude. Aircraft with higher total energy decide whether to engage, escape, or force the opponent to bleed momentum.

> **Pro Tip (Air):** Track both your airspeed indicator and climb angle. If speed drops below optimal corner speed during a defensive spiral, unload the nose to regain energy before committing to another pull.

### 2.3 Why Altitude Advantage Matters
Altitude grants:

- **Initiative:** you choose when to dive and where to exit.
- **Visibility:** spotting dots against lighter sky backgrounds is easier, while enemies below blend with terrain.
- **Safety buffer:** higher altitude equals more time to recover from stalls, compressibility, or critical damage.
- **Fuel efficiency:** many props climb more efficiently at higher altitude bands where engines breathe cooler air, granting longer WEP duration.
- **Team leverage:** maintaining a top-cover stack lets you pounce on bandits chasing your teammates, turning defensive fights into quick reversals.

[DIAGRAM: Energy state as a curve (high altitude → dive → attack → climb)]

### 2.4 Situational Awareness Aloft
- **Layered scanning:** alternate between long-range spotting, mid-range target tracking, and short-range collision checks.
- **Lead computation:** judge not just where a target is, but where it will be when you arrive.
- **Escape windows:** always plan where you will go after a pass. If the answer is “I don’t know,” you are already trapped.
- **Mental map:** constantly update a mental overlay of high-value zones (climb lanes, furballs, SPAA umbrellas) so you can route around danger without staring at the minimap for every decision.

### 2.5 Basic HUD Elements

| HUD Item | Meaning | Combat Application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Airspeed Indicator | Instant speed (IAS/TAS) | Maintain corner speed, avoid compressibility, time flaps |
| Altimeter / Radar Alt. | Height above sea or ground | Decide if you can dive without meeting terrain |
| Climb Indicator (VSI) | Rate of climb/descent | Monitor zoom efficiency and prevent sink on approach |
| Compass / Heading Tape | Relative nose direction | Maintain situational reference during merges |
| Lead Indicator (RB Aim Helper) | Predictive aiming cue | Useful but not perfect; still account for lag and convergence |

> **Warning:** Do not rely solely on the lead indicator. Server tick rate, lag, and target maneuvers mean you must still visualize bullet travel.

### 2.6 Flight Envelope Awareness
- **Redline speed:** know your aircraft’s structural limit and throttle down before diving past it.
- **Stall warnings:** buffeting, audible cues, or shaking indicate impending stall. Recover by easing back-stick, applying rudder, and adding throttle smoothly.
- **Control stiffening:** at high speed, roll and pitch authority reduce. Pre-trim before the dive, and use rudder to assist roll if ailerons lock up.

> **Pro Tip (Air):** Create a small kneeboard card (physical or digital) listing the stall speed, optimal climb speed, and rip speed for your favorite aircraft. Review it during loading screens until it becomes instinct.

### 2.7 Pre-Combat Checks
- **Control test:** wiggle ailerons, elevator, and rudder on runway to confirm bindings and axis curves are functioning.
- **Fuel load:** most Air RB sorties succeed with 20–30 minutes of fuel; carrying more adds weight and hurts climb.
- **Radiator/prop pitch:** if you use MEC, set default radiator openings and prop pitch before takeoff to avoid fiddling mid-climb.
- **Gun selection:** some aircraft carry mixed armaments. Decide whether to fire all guns together or bind cannons separately for precise bursts.
- **Situational briefing:** glance at roster, identify top-tier threats, and plan initial climb vector relative to sun position.

> **Warning:** Skipping pre-combat checks leads to embarrassing deaths (e.g., realizing guns were set to stealth belt when you needed tracers). Build a 10-second checklist before every sortie.

### 2.8 Weather & Lighting Considerations
- **Sun positioning:** climbing with the sun at your back blinds enemies below and hides your approach. Conversely, avoid attacking into the sun where your target can disappear in glare.
- **Cloud layers:** use clouds as concealment during climbs or disengagements, but remember they also block your own visibility. Practice popping in and out without losing orientation.
- **Storm turbulence:** heavy weather amplifies control inputs. Reduce elevator sensitivity or fly more gently to avoid structural failures.
- **Night battles:** rely on silhouettes, tracer flashes, and radar (if available). Dim cockpit lights to preserve night vision and avoid tunnel vision on instruments.
- **Fog and low ceilings:** in Ground RB, low clouds favor CAS because enemy fighters struggle to spot you until you emerge for the attack. Plan vertical pop-ups through cloud gaps.

## 3. Energy Fighting (Boom & Zoom Doctrine)

### 3.1 Core Concepts
- **Potential energy:** altitude, measured by a combination of height and gravity. An aircraft 2 km higher can convert that into a blistering dive without touching WEP.
- **Kinetic energy:** airspeed. High speed reduces exposure time in hostile zones and enables thicker control surfaces.
- **Energy conversion:** pitch down to trade altitude for speed (boom), then pitch up to trade speed back to altitude (zoom). Keep transitions smooth to reduce drag-induced energy bleed.
- **Energy retention:** aircraft with laminar wings or powerful engines (P-51, Fw 190D) retain energy better than turn fighters. Understand your platform so you know how aggressive each dive can be.

### 3.2 Boom & Zoom Cycle
1. **Climb above enemies**
   - Use shallow climb at full power to maintain speed; angle of 10–15° works for many props.
   - Avoid straight climb directly over enemy spawn; offset laterally to limit early spotting.
2. **Select isolated target**
   - Priority: lone aircraft, tunnel-vision attackers, or climbers unaware of you.
   - Cross-check with minimap to ensure no second bandit is trailing you.
   - Observe target aircraft type: high-wing monoplanes bleed speed faster than heavy energy fighters; pick prey you can finish in a single pass.
3. **Dive, attack in one pass**
   - Roll inverted, push nose down to maintain positive G on fuel systems.
   - Ideal dive angle: 30–60° depending on altitude delta and aircraft compressibility.
   - Fire only when lead solution is high-probability; one pass should decide the kill.
   - Track closure rate; if your IAS spikes past 750 km/h and controls stiffen, shallow the dive slightly to regain authority before firing.
4. **Zoom climb back to safety**
   - Pull up gently after trigger release; avoid flat turn or roll unless defensive break is required.
   - Use combat flaps sparingly to steady the gun platform, then retract before zooming.
   - Monitor VSI: if climb rate drops below zero during zoom, push nose down to rebuild speed, then resume climb.
5. **Reset**
   - Level off back at altitude, extend horizontally if chased, and repeat the cycle with another target.
    - Reassess fuel, ammunition, and teammate positions before committing to another pass.

[CURVE: Dive → lowest point at attack → zoom climb arc]

**Break-off cues**

- Excessive speed loss below corner speed during pull-up.
- Enemy wingman entering gun range from above.
- Control stiffening (compressibility) making the aircraft unresponsive.
- Ammunition exhaustion mid-pass; without bullets you cannot force the kill, so extend immediately.

**Common novice mistakes**

- **Staying low after the boom:** flat turning at low altitude throws away the energy advantage.
- **Over-committing to target fix:** diving steeply through multiple enemies with no exit path.
- **Extending in a straight line:** zooming directly away without jinking invites long-range shots.

### 3.3 Energy Traps

| Maneuver | Description | When to Use | Visual Cue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rope-a-Dope | Climb steeply to tempt a lower-energy pursuer into a climb they cannot sustain; roll off at stall to re-attack | Defensively vs tunnel-vision chasers | [VECTOR: upward spiral with pursuer stalling below] |
| High Yo-Yo | Pull up above the target’s turn circle, roll back down to cut inside | When you have speed excess but want to stay on tail | [SKETCH: rising arc then descending slash] |
| Low Yo-Yo | Drop below target’s plane, increase speed, then pull up into their six | When slightly slow; need to regain closure | [SKETCH: descending arc under enemy, arrow back up] |

> **Warning:** Do not perform rope-a-dope directly over enemy AAA or SPAA in combined battles. Even if the pursuer stalls, ground fire will finish you while you are slow and predictable.

> **Drill:** In test flight, place AI bomber at 3 km altitude. Perform alternating high and low yo-yos without firing, focusing only on matching exit speed with entry speed.

### 3.4 Energy Management Drills
1. **Spiral climb test:** start at 400 km/h IAS, climb in a gentle spiral while timing how long you maintain 250+ km/h. Note the altitude gained before stall warning—this is your rope-a-dope ceiling.
2. **Acceleration sprint:** from 1 km altitude, dive to sea level without exceeding rip speed, then level out and record how long it takes to reach 600 km/h. Compare across aircraft to know which can re-engage faster.
3. **Energy bleed evaluation:** execute a full-throttle 360° turn at corner speed and log entrance/exit IAS. Repeat at different flap settings to quantify drag penalties.
4. **Emergency zoom:** start 50 m above ground after a dive, pull into a 40° climb, and count seconds to reach 1000 m. This tests whether your aircraft can escape after a risky low-level attack.
5. **Mixed-fuel trials:** fly with minimum and maximum fuel loads to feel how energy retention changes; heavy tanks often demand gentler pulls.

## 4. Turn Fighting & Angles

### 4.1 Instant vs Sustained Turn
- **Instantaneous turn rate:** maximum rate you achieve during the first seconds of a pull when speed is high and wings are not yet loaded with drag.
- **Sustained turn rate:** the rate you can hold after drag and overheating settle in. This determines long-duration dogfights.
- **Corner speed:** specific speed where lift, drag, and engine thrust combine for the best sustained turn. Flying too fast overshoots the circle; too slow leads to stall buffet.
- **Energy bleed awareness:** watch the airspeed indicator during high-G pulls. If it drops faster than expected, unload the nose slightly to avoid entering an unrecoverable low-energy state.

### 4.2 When to Turn Fight
- **Turn-advantaged aircraft (e.g., Spitfire, A6M, I-153):** turn fight when energy states match and you have teammate cover.
- **Energy fighters (e.g., P-47, Fw 190, J7W1):** avoid flat circles unless the enemy already bled energy or you can convert into vertical loops.
- **Outnumbered:** never commit to a horizontal fight if more enemies lurk nearby; they will sandwich you.
- **Low energy:** defensive flat turn at low speed invites a stall and easy guns solution for the attacker.

> **Pro Tip (Air):** Brief yourself before each match: “I am flying a [turn/energy/multi-role] platform. My default engagement plan is ______.” Stating it aloud reduces the chance of reflexively entering fights your plane cannot win.

> **Warning:** If your aircraft overheats quickly (Yak series, F4Us on WEP), do not sit at full throttle in a prolonged turn. Cycle throttle or use manual pitch to stay in the green.

### 4.3 Horizontal vs Vertical Turns
- **Horizontal turns:** flat circles that rely on wing loading and flap management. Use combat flaps for short bursts; landing flaps only if the plane allows them without ripping.
- **Vertical turns:** loops, Immelmanns, and barrel rolls that trade speed for altitude and vice versa. Vertical moves punish opponents who cannot follow due to low energy.
- **Rolling scissors:** a hybrid vertical-horizontal engagement where both aircraft roll and pitch to stay in each other’s blind spots. Use if you have superior roll rate but equal energy.
- **Flat scissors:** lateral S-turns to force overshoot; only effective if your aircraft slows faster or has better instantaneous roll.
- **Vertical barrel roll:** climb and roll simultaneously to stay above the opponent’s nose; exit by dropping onto their six when they stall.

**Scenario – Turnfighter vs Energy Fighter**
- You fly a Spitfire against a P-47. Force the P-47 into repeated flat turns by cutting across their circle and using combat flaps. Maintain 280–320 km/h IAS to preserve lift.

**Scenario – Energy Fighter vs Better Turner**
- You fly an Fw 190 against a Yak-3. Refuse horizontal merges. Climb shallow, bait the Yak into a spiral, then roll into a vertical split-S and boom as they stall.

> **Pro Tip (Air):** Assign a key to deploy airbrakes or cut throttle slightly when overshooting during a turn. Managing closure allows you to stay on the target’s tail instead of slingshotting past.

### 4.4 Turn-Fight Drills
1. **Corner speed calibration:** in test flight, accelerate to various speeds and pull max G turns for 90°. Note which speed yields the tightest radius without stall; mark it as your corner speed.
2. **Flap discipline:** run repeated 360° turns alternating flaps (retracted/combat/landing). Record time to complete each circle and observe stall onset to learn safe deployment windows.
3. **Two-circle duel:** squad with a friend and practice pure horizontal merges. Swap aircraft every few attempts to understand both sides of the engagement.
4. **Vertical loop practice:** start at 400 km/h and perform consecutive loops, keeping the nose tracking the same reference cloud at the top. Focus on easing the pull at the apex to avoid stalls.
5. **Rolling scissors simulator:** chase AI or a friend at low altitude, intentionally overshoot, then use differential throttle and roll to regain position without hitting the ground.

## 5. Situational Awareness in the Air

### 5.1 Scan Discipline
- **360° scan habit:** every 5 seconds, roll slightly to expose both wingtips and scan the horizon.
- **Check six:** quick look behind after every attack, even if no warning sounds triggered.
- **Track multiple contacts:** prioritize bandits by threat level; memorize their relative clock positions.
- **Instrument glance:** include quick checks of altimeter, throttle, and oil temps to avoid mechanical surprises during combat.
- **Audio cues:** engine pitch shifts and bullet cracks reveal unseen threats. Fly with good audio mix and reduce music volume to keep cues clear.

### 5.2 Reading the Fight
- Identify **altitude stacks:** note who controls high, mid, low layers. If enemies dominate high altitude, avoid climbing alone into their kill box.
- Judge **speed differentials:** contrails and blur streaks reveal fast-moving aircraft; slow-flying dots indicate potential victims but also bait.
- **Avoid furball dives:** before diving into a chaotic cluster, know your exit direction, altitude floor, and friendly positions.
- **Assess objective status:** check tickets, bases, and ground targets. Sometimes best move is to climb and kill bombers rather than feed into a furball.

### 5.3 Common Awareness Mistakes
- **Tunnel vision:** staring at one opponent until another quietly lines up a perfect shot.
- **Chasing low into spawn:** dragging fights over enemy AAA ensures death and denies your team coverage.
- **Ignoring teammates:** not noticing friendly fighters chasing your target leads to collisions or wasted ordnance.
- **Forgetting minimap sweeps:** the radar/minimap still provides bearing hints—skip it too long and you miss high-speed interceptors streaking in from the edge.

[AWARENESS LOOP DIAGRAM: check instruments → horizon → six → minimap → target]

> **Drill:** Fly a match focusing solely on scans. Count aloud: “front, left, right, six, instruments.” Ignore safe shots if the scan cycle would break—build habit before adding aggression.

### 5.4 Awareness Exercises
1. **Clock callouts:** in replay mode, pause every 30 seconds and list the clock bearing of each enemy relative to your aircraft. Compare to actual positions to gauge perception accuracy.
2. **Six-check timer:** set a metronome app to 6-second intervals; each tone forces a quick glance behind. Continue until it becomes subconscious.
3. **Minimap discipline:** disable map icons in custom battles and rely solely on visual spotting. Re-enable icons later to appreciate how much information they actually provide.
4. **Wingman tracking:** fly with a friend and keep them within vision even while engaging enemies. Swap roles to understand formation responsibilities.
5. **Threat prioritization notes:** after each death, write down which contact actually killed you and whether you noticed them earlier. Patterns reveal blind spots (e.g., high twelve, low five).

## 6. Gunnery & Aiming
Precision gunnery separates consistent aces from lucky passersby. Treat each aircraft as a unique weapons platform. Record impressions (recoil, tracer fall, muzzle velocity) in a small log so you can refresh quickly after flying other nations.

### 6.1 Lead & Convergence
- **Gun convergence:** distance where wing-mounted guns cross. Typical RB values: 300–500 m. Set based on typical engagement range; shorter convergence for knife fights, longer for BnZ passes.
- **Leading targets:** imagine a 3D bubble ahead of the bandit. The faster they move or the greater the crossing angle, the further ahead you must aim.
- **Practice:** test flight + gun target drones. Fire short bursts to see tracer paths; adjust convergence until hits cluster consistently.
- **Convergence review:** revisit settings when switching between nations. American .50 cals often favor longer convergence; Japanese cannons prefer shorter distances due to slower muzzle velocity.

### 6.2 Firing Discipline
- **Short bursts:** 0.5–1 second bursts maintain barrel temperature and conserve ammo.
- **Trigger patience:** hold fire unless the entire fuselage or wing root is in your sights.
- **Ammunition awareness:** many planes carry limited cannon rounds; track remaining belts before re-engaging.
- **Ammo belts:** choose belts that match role—AP-I for armored targets, stealth belts for surprise, universal belts for mixed engagements. Rebind ammo count HUD toggle if hidden by custom UI.
- **Recoil control:** heavy cannons (NS-45, BK 5) kick the nose upward. Counter by trimming nose-down prior to firing or by tapping the trigger instead of holding it.

### 6.3 Attack Geometry
- **Head-ons:** high risk. Only accept if aircraft is equally armed and you have no escape. Offset slightly and fire in a slicing pass rather than nose-on.
- **High deflection shots:** attack from above or below and aim where the target will be when you cross paths. Great for breaking enemy wings with MG 151, 20 mm Hispanos, or .50 cals.
- **Tail chases:** easier aim but risk of friendly fire and tunnel vision. Maintain small vertical offset to watch tracers.
- **Oblique CAS approaches:** attack SPAA or fighters from 20–30° offset to reduce exposure to concentrated fire.

Examples:
- **High-side pass:** roll inverted above target, dive diagonally, fire, and break upward.
- **Low six attack:** sneak under target’s six o’clock, climb gently, fire into engine block.
- **Oblique vs SPAA:** approach at tree-top level, jink laterally, release rockets, immediately break behind cover.

> **Warning:** Avoid firing rockets at extreme ranges. Inaccurate salvos alert SPAA and waste limited ordnance.

> **Pro Tip (Air):** When unsure about lead, fire a short “rangefinder” burst slightly behind the target. Adjust based on tracer feedback, then commit the main burst once the stream walks onto the fuselage.

## 7. CAS (Close Air Support) in Ground Battles

### 7.1 When to Spawn CAS
- **Spawn points:** wait until you can afford both an aircraft and emergency respawn if needed.
- **Enemy SPAA status:** if multiple radar SPAAs are alive (e.g., ZSU-57-2 quad, Gepard), coordinate suppression first.
- **Frontline clarity:** spawn when friendly tanks have identified targets and air cover is minimal; avoid launching blindly into chaotic early-game fights.

> **Pro Tip (Air):** Keep a mental SL budget. If repair costs exceed expected CAS reward, delay spawning until victory is likely or until you can chain multiple kills per sortie.

> **Warning:** If your team lacks air cover and enemy fighters patrol the area, spawning a slow attacker invites immediate interception. Consider spawning AA tank first, securing the skies, then committing CAS.

### 7.2 Attack Profiles
Before taxiing, run a mental CAS brief:

- **Ingress route:** altitude, terrain masking, and sun angle.
- **Attack axis:** approach direction relative to frontline and friendly SPAAs.
- **Ordnance pairing:** match weapon type to expected armor (HE for light, AP for heavy).
- **Egress plan:** decide whether you will zoom climb, terrain-follow, or dive away before you even take off.

#### Bombs
- **Dive bombing (30–60°):** ideal for small targets. Begin dive 1500–2000 m out, align reticle with target’s lead, release at 500–800 m altitude, pull up gently.
- **Level bombing:** for heavy bombers; use bombsight while flying steady at altitude. Ensure target area is safe from fighters before committing.
- **Shallow dives (15–25°):** used by fighter-bombers to maintain speed. Release early and rely on speed to escape.
- **Moving targets:** lead ahead of tank’s direction; release when your shadow is roughly half a hull length before the target.

#### Rockets
- **Salvo vs singles:** salvo for wide columns or if rockets have low individual explosive mass. Single shots when using high-pen rockets (HVAR, S-24) against specific tanks.
- **Approach angle:** 5–15° shallow run reduces time under SPAA but requires precise lead.
- **Unexpected vectors:** approach from behind ridgelines or along rivers to exploit blind spots.
- **Ripple timing:** stagger rocket fire by fractions of a second to bracket moving targets; the first rocket forces maneuver, the second capitalizes on predicted correction.

#### Guns
- **Strafing:** target open-top TDs, SPAAs, or light vehicles. Use AP belts for armored cars, HEI for soft targets.
- **Gun runs:** start high, dive to 400–600 m altitude, fire short bursts, pull up before overflying the target. Never fly straight down a road where SPAAs expect you.
- **Gun pods:** if your nation offers external gun pods, remember they add drag. Account for decreased climb rate and longer acceleration before re-entering the fight.

[ATTACK PROFILE: 30–45° dive onto tank]

[ROCKET RUN: low-level approach, pull-up, fire, break away]

### 7.3 Surviving SPAA
- **Stay low and fast:** tree-top flight hides you from radar and makes prediction difficult.
- **Terrain masking:** use hills, buildings, and smoke screens to break line-of-sight.
- **Zig-zag:** weave gently on approach; sudden jinks cause SPAA gunners to miss range calculations.
- **Break early:** if tracers close within 50 m, abort run and reposition.
- **Altitude shift:** occasionally climb to medium altitude to reset angles, then dive from unexpected direction.
- **Counter-fires:** if you spot SPAA muzzle flashes, relay coordinates to ground teammates so they can suppress between your runs.

### 7.4 Team Coordination
- **Communication:** ping suspected SPAA locations, call out destroyed AA so allied pilots know when to press.
- **Combined arms:** coordinate with tankers to mark targets with smoke or radio pings; request them to suppress SPAA before you attack.
- **Timing:** synchronize with ground pushes. Drop ordnance right before a capture attempt to maximize chaos.
- **Spawn order:** discuss with squadmates who spawns fighter cover and who brings CAS. A single escort fighter multiplying CAS survivability is often worth more than an extra bomb load.

> **Drill:** In custom battle, practice flying low-level routes around a city map. Mark safe corridors and rehearse pop-up attacks on marked positions.

### 7.5 Loadout Planning
- **Modular kits:** memorize which pylons carry bombs vs rockets so you can tailor loadouts quickly during spawn countdown.
- **Fuse settings:** adjust bomb fuses based on target type—0.5 s for open-top vehicles, 1.5+ s for armored columns to avoid self-damage during low drops.
- **Gun belt pairing:** if running mixed belts, put AP belts on primary trigger for armored targets and HE belts on secondary for soft ones.
- **Countermeasure quantity:** jets should track flare/chaff counts; consider carrying fewer bombs to install extra countermeasure pods if available.
- **Repair costs vs ordnance:** heavy guided munitions often raise repair bills. Ensure expected target value (SPAA, cap breaker) justifies the expense.

## 8. Jets & Missile Era Fundamentals

### 8.1 Speed & Energy in Jets
- **Speed is life:** jets bleed energy slower but require more distance to accelerate. Maintain high subsonic speeds (800–950 km/h IAS) before engaging.
- **Compressibility:** at high Mach, control surfaces stiffen. Anticipate by trimming nose up and planning exit altitude.
- **Energy planning:** break turns gently; a heavy pull can drop speed below 600 km/h and make you a missile target.
- **Afterburner management:** in aircraft with limited fuel, pulse afterburner on ingress or during missile evasion rather than running it continuously.
- **Lag pursuit:** use lag pursuit to stay behind fast opponents without overshooting—offset slightly outside their turn circle and rejoin once they bleed speed.

### 8.2 IR Missiles (Basics)
- **Rear-aspect missiles:** require hot exhaust. Launch from 1.5–2 km tail chase when target is not maneuvering.
- **All-aspect missiles:** stronger seekers but still temperature-limited. Firing head-on at long range wastes ordnance.
- **Launch discipline:** wait for solid tone/lock, ensure no friendlies cross the seeker cone, and avoid firing inside sharp turns that cause missile to overshoot.
- **Counter-countermeasures:** anticipate enemies pre-flaring. Delay launch until they stop dropping decoys or fire from a different aspect to force them to choose between maneuvering and flaring.

### 8.3 Flares & Defensive Flying
- **Timing:** drop flares as missile leaves the rail, not before. Delayed release ensures seeker sees a large signature separation.
- **Maneuver:** combine flare release with sharp break turn and throttle cut to reduce exhaust heat.
- **Unpredictability:** vary altitude, roll, and throttle to make lock reacquisition harder.
- **Chaff (if equipped):** use against radar-guided missiles together with hard 90° turns to break radar lock.

### 8.4 Radar & BVR (Conceptual)
- **Radar lock:** aircraft emits beam to track targets; break lock by presenting a 90° aspect (“notching”) or hiding behind terrain.
- **Terrain masking:** mountains, valleys, or even city blocks block radar line-of-sight.
- **BVR mindset:** even when you lack radar missiles, understanding radar cones helps you anticipate when opponents will fire and how to stay off their scope.

> **Warning:** Never fly straight toward a radar-equipped enemy while they are head-on. Offset early to force them to roll and re-acquire, buying time to notch.

> **Pro Tip (Air):** Learn the typical radar search modes (RWS, TWS, ACM) described in your aircraft’s stat-card or community guides. Knowing whether an opponent likely has a wide or narrow cone helps you choose the best evasion pattern.

### 8.5 Jet Combat Drills
1. **Boom-and-zoom at Mach:** practice shallow Mach dives in custom battles to feel when compressibility starts. Rehearse recovery using elevator trim and controlled pull-outs.
2. **Missile spacing:** in test flight, fire IR missiles at drones from varying ranges to catalog maximum practical range. Note which missiles require closer shots.
3. **Notch timing:** set up duel with a friend; have them lock you with radar while you practice 90° beam maneuvers combined with chaff drops.
4. **Fuel discipline:** fly three back-to-back sorties with different fuel loads (minimum, medium, full) and record time-on-station vs climb performance.
5. **High-speed scissors:** practice rolling scissors above 800 km/h IAS to master throttle chops and airbrake usage without inducing compressor stalls.

## 9. BR Progression & Air Lineups

### 9.1 Prop Era (BR 1.0–4.7)
- Focus on **energy management**, **basic gunnery**, and **situational awareness**.
- Build lineups with 2–3 fighters and 1 attacker/bomber for economic safety.
- Example “Trainer” lineup (generic nations):
  - Reserve/early fighter (e.g., I-16, Gladiator) for dogfight practice.
  - Energy-focused fighter (e.g., Bf 109 E, P-36) to rehearse climbs.
  - Light attacker (e.g., Ju 87, IL-2 early) for CAS training.
- Supplement with an AA truck or SPAA in Ground RB so you can influence the air war even after losing aircraft.
- Rotate between nations weekly to avoid tunnel vision; knowing enemy climb rates from personal experience makes counter-tactics intuitive.

### 9.2 Early Jets (BR 5.7–8.3)
- Learn **speed discipline** and **compressibility management**.
- Example “Intermediate” lineup:
  - Early straight-wing jet (F-80, MiG-9).
  - Swept-wing fighter (MiG-15bis, F-86F) for advanced BnZ.
  - Fighter-bomber (Me 262 A-1/U4, Canberra) for mixed CAS practice.
- Carry mixed ordnance options (bombs + gun pods) to flex between air superiority and CAS depending on the lobby composition.
- Practice manual engine control (MEC) to manage turbine temps and avoid compressor stalls during extended climbs.

### 9.3 Supersonic & Missile Era (BR 9.0+)
- Prioritize survival, missile management, and radar awareness.
- Example “High-tier” lineup:
  - All-aspect missile fighter (F-5E, MiG-29SMT depending on tree).
  - Dedicated striker (Su-17M2, A-7D) with guided ordnance for CAS.
  - Backup fighter with different missile mix for flexibility.
- Consider premium/event aircraft that reduce repair costs for long grind sessions, but ensure they fit the doctrine (no point flying a strike jet if the lineup needs interceptors).
- Keep a “decompression” lineup in the 6.0–7.0 range to rebuild confidence and wallet when top-tier losses stack up.

> **Pro Tip (Air):** Keep backup crews stocked with spaded aircraft so that a single death does not end your sortie chain. Rotate aircraft with varying repair costs to stay SL-positive.

## 10. Training Drills & Practice Routines (Air)

### 10.1 Aim & Gunnery Routine
1. Load test flight with AI drones.
2. Spend 10 minutes firing only at 400–600 m range, tracking tracers.
3. Switch to custom battle, spawn multiple AI fighters, and practice deflection shots from 30° angles.
4. Review replays to see bullet dispersion and adjust convergence.
5. Finish by flying an Air RB match where you limit yourself to 100 rounds per engagement to enforce trigger discipline.

### 10.2 Energy Management Routine
1. Select your main fighter in test flight.
2. Perform climb-dive-zoom cycles: climb to 3000 m, dive to 1000 m, destroy ground target, zoom back to 2500+ m without dropping below corner speed.
3. Repeat five times, noting entry and exit speeds to ensure minimal energy loss.
4. Add rolling scissors after each zoom climb to practice defensive exits.

### 10.3 Awareness Routine
1. Enter Air RB and commit to scanning every 5 seconds.
2. Verbally call out clock positions for each spotted bandit, even if playing solo.
3. Abort attacks that would break the scan rhythm. Prioritize survival over kills.
4. After match, analyze kill-cam deaths to identify awareness lapses.

> **Drill:** Record gameplay and overlay a metronome audio track. Each beat triggers a new scan direction until habit forms.

### 10.4 CAS Accuracy Routine
1. Create a custom Ground RB lobby with stationary AI tanks.
2. Practice dive bombing at varying angles, using manual distance callouts before release.
3. Repeat rocket runs using both salvo and single-shot methods, logging hit percentages.
4. Fly nap-of-the-earth circuits around the map, timing how long you remain below 50 m altitude without striking obstacles.
5. Conclude with live-match CAS sorties, aiming for at least one vehicle kill per spawn before re-arming.

### 10.5 Missile Defense Routine
1. In test flight or custom battle, spawn AI jets capable of firing IR missiles.
2. Fly parallel to them, inviting missile launches, then practice timed flare drops while executing hard breaks.
3. Alternate between low-altitude terrain masking and high-altitude barrel rolls to memorize different defeat patterns.
4. Track success rate (missile defeated vs hit) and adjust timing until you can beat three consecutive launches.
5. Transfer the routine to live Air RB matches by deliberately baiting one missile early and defeating it before committing to offense.

## 11. Common Mistakes in Air Combat & How to Fix Them

| Mistake | Why It’s Bad | Correct Behavior / Drill |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Taking every head-on | Trades your life on coin flips; enemies with cannons win | Offset approach, dodge late, re-engage from advantage |
| Coming in low and slow | Makes you easy prey for higher enemies | Climb on spawn, enter fights with altitude cushion |
| Chasing into enemy spawn | AAA destroys you and removes presence from frontline | Break off at 3 km from spawn perimeter; re-climb |
| Ignoring altitude | Gives initiative to opponents | Maintain at least equal altitude to nearest threat |
| Firing at impossible ranges | Wastes ammo, alerts target | Practice holding fire until within 0.8–1.0 km |
| Flat turning in energy fighter | Bleeds speed, invites stall | Use vertical maneuvers or extend |
| Tunnel vision on one target | Leaves you blind to threats | Insert scan checks between bursts |
| Overusing WEP | Overheats engine, reduces power mid-fight | Pulse WEP; monitor temperature gauges |
| Forgetting convergence | Shots miss due to spreading fire | Set convergence before sortie; test in practice |
| Not binding elevator trim | Limits precision at high speed | Bind trim and practice micro-adjustments |
| Spawning CAS instantly | Dies to fresh SPAAs, wastes SP | Wait for intel, coordinate with ground |
| Flying straight at SPAA | Predictable and fatal | Approach with weaving, altitude changes |
| Holding trigger nonstop | Causes jams, empties ammo | Fire short bursts, conserve rounds |
| No escape plan before dive | Ends in furballs with no exit | Plan climb-out heading before attacking |
| Ignoring wingman positions | Collisions or kill steals, no mutual cover | Call targets, deconflict attack lanes |
| Not checking controls after damage | Hidden jammed surfaces cause crashes | After taking hits, perform gentle roll/pitch test |
| Launching missiles without ID | Friendly fire or wasted ordnance | Confirm target via silhouette/minimap before firing |
| Running identical lineup slots | Lacks flexibility when meta shifts | Mix energy fighters, turnfighters, and attackers |
| Neglecting weather effects | Attacking into sun or clouds blinds you | Incorporate weather into briefing; reposition accordingly |
| Ignoring engine temperatures | Engine seizes mid-fight | Monitor gauges, reduce throttle, open radiators |

## 12. Summary & Where to Go Next
Mastering the Air Academy means internalizing energy, angles, awareness, and discipline. Boom-and-zoom pilots learn to attack with purpose; turn fighters understand when to commit; CAS specialists treat every sortie as a combined-arms mission. Keep refining:

- **Nation Guides:** apply doctrine to specific aircraft characteristics.
- **Ground Academy:** coordinate CAS with tank pushes.
- **Map Tactics Academy:** learn spawn altitudes, cloud cover, and terrain features for air maps.
- **Weapons & Systems:** dive deeper into missile seekers, radar filters, and ballistic tables.
- **Meta Hub:** stay updated on aircraft balance changes and lineup recommendations.
- **Economy Lab:** plan boosters, wagers, and premium time so that practicing these drills remains profitable rather than punishing.

Stay methodical, fly the plan, and iterate every sortie. Keep a training journal, review replays weekly, and adjust doctrine as Gaijin patches shift the meta. The sky belongs to pilots who treat every maneuver as part of a doctrine, not a gamble.
