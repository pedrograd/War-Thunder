# Chapter 1: Tank Fundamentals

Welcome to your first chapter of Ground Forces Academy! This chapter will teach you the fundamental concepts of tank combat in War Thunder.

## Understanding Shell Types

Different shell types behave very differently. Understanding when and how to use each type is critical to success.

### APFSDS (Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot)

**Best for**: Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) at high BR tiers

**Characteristics**:
- High penetration, low explosive mass
- Excellent at penetrating thick armor
- Requires precise aiming at weak spots or armor gaps
- Minimal post-penetration damage (relies on crew/module hits)

**When to use**: Against heavily armored targets (MBTs at 7.0+ BR)

### AP (Armor-Piercing)

**Best for**: Medium BR tiers (4.0-7.0)

**Characteristics**:
- Moderate penetration
- Solid shot or capped armor-piercing
- Good penetration at range
- Moderate post-penetration damage

**When to use**: General-purpose against medium armor

### HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank)

**Best for**: Lower BR tiers, dealing with angled armor

**Characteristics**:
- Chemical penetration (not affected by armor angle)
- Excellent penetration values
- Can be stopped by spaced armor or ERA
- Good post-penetration damage

**When to use**: Against heavily angled armor or composite armor

### HESH (High-Explosive Squash Head)

**Best for**: British tanks, dealing with lightly armored vehicles

**Characteristics**:
- Explosive warhead that squashes on impact
- Creates spalling on the inside of armor
- Lower penetration than AP shells
- Excellent against light vehicles and side armor

**When to use**: Against light tanks, SPAA, or side armor of medium tanks

### HE (High-Explosive)

**Best for**: Light vehicles, open-top vehicles, modules

**Characteristics**:
- Large explosive mass
- Minimal armor penetration
- High damage if it penetrates
- Can destroy external modules without penetration

**When to use**: Against open-top vehicles, light tanks, or to damage modules on heavier tanks

## Armor Basics

### Armor Thickness

- Armor is measured in millimeters (mm)
- Thicker armor = harder to penetrate
- Effective armor thickness changes with angle

### Effective Armor Thickness

When a shell hits armor at an angle, it must travel through more armor:
- **Formula**: Effective Thickness = Actual Thickness / cos(angle)
- **Example**: 100mm armor at 60° angle = 200mm effective thickness

### Armor Types

1. **Homogeneous Steel**: Standard solid armor
2. **Composite Armor**: Layers of different materials (ceramics, steel, etc.)
3. **ERA (Explosive Reactive Armor)**: Explosive plates that defeat HEAT
4. **Spaced Armor**: Air gaps between armor plates

## Penetration Mechanics

### Penetration Values

Every shell has penetration values at different ranges:
- **10m**: Maximum penetration (close range)
- **100m, 500m, 1000m, 2000m**: Penetration at various ranges
- **60°**: Penetration against angled armor

### Factors Affecting Penetration

1. **Range**: Penetration decreases with distance
2. **Angle**: Angled armor is harder to penetrate
3. **Shell Type**: Different shells have different penetration characteristics
4. **Normalization**: Some shells can "normalize" (straighten) on impact

## Key Concepts

### Overmatching

When a shell's caliber is much larger than armor thickness:
- **Rule**: Caliber > 3 × Armor Thickness = Overmatch
- **Effect**: Shell can ignore armor angle in many cases
- **Example**: 152mm shell vs 50mm armor = overmatch

### Weak Spots

All tanks have vulnerable areas:
- **Lower Front Plate**: Often thinner than upper plate
- **Side Armor**: Usually much thinner than front armor
- **Rear Armor**: Weakest armor on most tanks
- **Turret Ring**: Gap between hull and turret
- **Commander's Cupola**: Often weak spot on turret
- **Side of Turret**: Often weaker than front

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Shell Type Identification

In your hangar, examine 3 different tanks:
1. Identify available shell types for each
2. Note penetration values at 10m and 1000m
3. Understand when to use each shell type

### Exercise 2: Weak Spot Recognition

Study 5 different vehicles:
1. Identify at least 3 weak spots on each
2. Note armor thickness values (if visible)
3. Think about angles you'd need to hit weak spots

### Exercise 3: Penetration Calculation

Given:
- Shell penetration: 200mm at 10m
- Target armor: 100mm at 45° angle

Calculate effective armor thickness and determine if shell can penetrate.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Using wrong shell type**: Using HE against heavy tanks, APFSDS against light tanks
2. **Ignoring armor angle**: Shooting angled armor with low-pen shells
3. **Not aiming for weak spots**: Shooting center mass instead of vulnerable areas
4. **Not checking penetration values**: Using shells that can't penetrate target

## What's Next?

In **Chapter 2: Armor Mechanics**, we'll dive deeper into armor angles, composite armor, and how to maximize your armor protection while minimizing enemy penetration chances.
