# Chapter 3: Weak Spots

Knowing where to shoot is often more important than what you're shooting with. This chapter will teach you how to identify and exploit weak spots on every vehicle type.

## What Are Weak Spots?

**Definition**: Areas on a vehicle with less armor protection than other areas.

**Why They Exist**:
- Design constraints (can't armor everything)
- Weight limitations (too much armor = too heavy)
- Functional requirements (hatches, viewports, etc.)
- Manufacturing limitations

**Key Insight**: Every vehicle has weak spots - learning them is crucial for success.

## Common Weak Spot Locations

### 1. Lower Front Plate

**Why it's weak**:
- Usually thinner than upper front plate
- More vertical (less angled)
- Easier to penetrate

**How to exploit**:
- Aim for lower front plate when facing enemy
- Most reliable weak spot on most tanks
- Works at most angles

**Example**: T-34 lower front plate is much weaker than upper sloped plate

### 2. Side Armor

**Why it's weak**:
- Much thinner than front armor
- Usually not angled
- Easy to penetrate

**How to exploit**:
- Flank enemies to hit sides
- Even heavy tanks have weak sides
- Often leads to ammo rack hits

**Example**: Tiger I has 80mm side armor vs 100mm+ front armor

### 3. Rear Armor

**Why it's weak**:
- Weakest armor on most vehicles
- Usually very thin
- Often contains engine/ammo

**How to exploit**:
- Get behind enemies
- Very high chance of penetration
- Often causes fires or ammo detonation

**Example**: Most tanks have 20-40mm rear armor

### 4. Turret Ring

**Why it's weak**:
- Gap between hull and turret
- Often not well protected
- Can disable turret rotation

**How to exploit**:
- Aim for gap between hull and turret
- Can disable turret
- Sometimes penetrates into crew compartment

**Example**: Many tanks have vulnerable turret rings

### 5. Commander's Cupola

**Why it's weak**:
- Often thinner than turret face
- Protrudes from turret
- Easy target

**How to exploit**:
- Aim for cupola when facing turret
- Can kill commander
- Sometimes penetrates into turret

**Example**: Many German tanks have prominent cupolas

### 6. Roof Armor

**Why it's weak**:
- Very thin on most vehicles
- Vulnerable to artillery
- Vulnerable to aircraft

**How to exploit**:
- Attack from above (rare opportunity)
- Artillery can penetrate roofs
- Aircraft can attack roofs

**Example**: Most tanks have 10-30mm roof armor

### 7. Viewports and Hatches

**Why they're weak**:
- Functional openings
- Usually weaker than surrounding armor
- Small targets

**How to exploit**:
- Aim for driver's viewport
- Aim for hatches
- Requires precise aiming

**Example**: Driver's viewport on many tanks

## Vehicle Type Weak Spots

### Heavy Tanks

**Common Weak Spots**:
- Lower front plate
- Side armor (especially if not angled)
- Commander's cupola
- Turret ring
- Roof (if accessible)

**Strategy**: Heavy tanks rely on front armor - hit weak spots or flank

### Medium Tanks

**Common Weak Spots**:
- Lower front plate
- Side armor
- Turret face (often weaker than heavy tanks)
- Roof

**Strategy**: Medium tanks are more balanced - multiple weak spot options

### Light Tanks

**Common Weak Spots**:
- Everywhere (thin armor overall)
- Especially sides and rear
- Roof

**Strategy**: Light tanks are vulnerable everywhere - aim center mass

### Tank Destroyers

**Common Weak Spots**:
- Side armor (especially vulnerable)
- Rear armor
- Roof
- Often no turret (weak if flanked)

**Strategy**: TDs are strong frontally but weak on sides - flank them

## How to Find Weak Spots

### Method 1: Hangar Inspection

**How to do it**:
1. Go to hangar
2. Select vehicle
3. Use X-Ray view
4. Check armor values
5. Note weak areas

**Best for**: Learning specific vehicles

### Method 2: Testing in Matches

**How to do it**:
1. Shoot different areas
2. See what penetrates
3. Learn through experience
4. Remember what works

**Best for**: Practical learning

### Method 3: Weak Spot Guides

**How to do it**:
1. Check weak spot library
2. Study diagrams
3. Learn common patterns
4. Apply in matches

**Best for**: Quick reference

### Method 4: Experience

**How to do it**:
1. Play many matches
2. Learn what works
3. Remember successful shots
4. Build knowledge over time

**Best for**: Long-term mastery

## Aiming Techniques

### Leading Your Target

**When to use**: Enemy is moving

**How to do it**:
- Aim ahead of moving target
- Account for shell travel time
- Practice to learn lead distance
- Adjust for target speed

### Aiming for Weak Spots

**Key Principles**:
- Take time to aim
- Don't rush shots
- Aim for center of weak spot
- Wait for good opportunity

### Range Considerations

**Close Range (< 500m)**:
- Easier to hit weak spots
- Can aim precisely
- Less shell drop

**Medium Range (500-1000m)**:
- Still possible to hit weak spots
- Account for shell drop
- Aim slightly higher

**Long Range (1000m+)**:
- Harder to hit weak spots
- May need to aim for larger areas
- Account for shell drop and travel time

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Weak Spot Identification

1. Go to hangar
2. Select 5 different vehicles
3. Use X-Ray view
4. Identify 3 weak spots on each
5. Note armor thickness values

**Goal**: Learn to identify weak spots

### Exercise 2: Aiming Practice

1. In a match, take time to aim
2. Always aim for weak spots
3. Don't rush shots
4. Practice precision aiming

**Goal**: Improve weak spot accuracy

### Exercise 3: Flanking Practice

1. Use mobility to flank enemies
2. Aim for side armor
3. Practice getting side shots
4. Learn flanking routes

**Goal**: Master flanking for weak spot access

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Shooting Center Mass

**What happens**: Shell hits strong armor, bounces or doesn't penetrate

**How to avoid**: Always aim for weak spots

### Mistake 2: Rushing Shots

**What happens**: Miss weak spot, hit strong armor

**How to avoid**: Take time to aim properly

### Mistake 3: Not Knowing Weak Spots

**What happens**: Can't penetrate enemies effectively

**How to avoid**: Study weak spots, use guides

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Angles

**What happens**: Weak spot becomes harder to hit due to angle

**How to avoid**: Consider angles when aiming

## Advanced Concepts

### Overmatching Weak Spots

**When**: Your shell caliber is much larger than weak spot armor

**Effect**: Shell can penetrate even at angles

**Example**: 152mm shell vs 30mm side armor = overmatch

### Shell Type Selection

**APFSDS**: Best for thick weak spots (lower front plate)

**HEAT**: Good for angled weak spots (if not composite)

**AP**: General purpose for weak spots

**HE**: Can damage weak spots without penetration

## What's Next?

Now that you understand weak spots, it's time to learn about **positioning** in Chapter 4. Good positioning allows you to expose enemy weak spots while protecting your own!

*Remember: Knowing weak spots is half the battle - good positioning gets you the angles to hit them!*
