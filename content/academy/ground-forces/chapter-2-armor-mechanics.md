# Chapter 2: Armor Mechanics

Understanding armor mechanics is crucial for both protecting yourself and penetrating enemy armor. This chapter will teach you everything about armor angles, effective thickness, and how to use armor effectively.

## Armor Thickness Basics

### Understanding Millimeters (mm)

Armor thickness in War Thunder is measured in millimeters:
- **Thin Armor**: 10-30mm (light vehicles, sides of tanks)
- **Medium Armor**: 40-80mm (front armor of medium tanks, sides of heavy tanks)
- **Thick Armor**: 100-200mm (front armor of heavy tanks, turret faces)
- **Very Thick Armor**: 200mm+ (top-tier MBTs, composite armor)

### Nominal vs. Effective Thickness

**Nominal Thickness**: The actual thickness of the armor plate (e.g., 100mm)

**Effective Thickness**: How much armor a shell must penetrate at an angle (e.g., 100mm at 60° = 200mm effective)

**Key Concept**: Effective thickness is what matters for penetration, not nominal thickness!

## The Angle Formula

### Basic Formula

**Effective Thickness = Nominal Thickness / cos(angle)**

Where:
- **Angle**: The angle between the shell's path and the armor plate (0° = perpendicular, 90° = parallel)

### Common Angles and Effectiveness

| Angle | cos(angle) | Multiplier | Example: 100mm Armor |
|-------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| 0° (perpendicular) | 1.0 | 1.0× | 100mm effective |
| 30° | 0.87 | 1.15× | 115mm effective |
| 45° | 0.71 | 1.41× | 141mm effective |
| 60° | 0.50 | 2.0× | 200mm effective |
| 70° | 0.34 | 2.94× | 294mm effective |
| 75° | 0.26 | 3.86× | 386mm effective |

**Key Insight**: Armor becomes exponentially more effective as angles increase!

## Using Angles to Your Advantage

### Hull Down Position

**Definition**: Showing only your turret, hiding your hull behind cover

**Why it works**:
- Turret armor is usually thicker than hull armor
- Only a small target for enemies
- Can angle turret for additional protection

**How to achieve**:
1. Find a hill or elevated position
2. Reverse until only turret is visible
3. Angle turret slightly if possible
4. Engage enemies from this position

### Angling Your Tank

**Basic Angling**:
- Don't face enemies directly with front armor
- Angle your hull 15-30° from enemy
- Increases effective armor thickness
- Creates more difficult target

**Advanced Angling**:
- Learn optimal angles for your vehicle
- Balance between armor protection and gun arc
- Consider where shells will bounce

### Reverse Sidescraping

**Definition**: Hiding most of your tank behind cover, showing only angled side armor

**How it works**:
- Side armor is angled at extreme angle (70°+)
- Creates very high effective armor
- Most shells will bounce off

**How to execute**:
1. Position tank next to corner
2. Angle so side armor faces enemy at 70°+
3. Only expose turret or small part of side
4. Fire when enemy reloads

## Armor Types and Their Properties

### Homogeneous Steel Armor

**Characteristics**:
- Solid steel plate
- Standard armor in most vehicles
- Penetration works as normal with angles

**Behavior**:
- Consistent protection
- Angle formula applies directly
- Can be penetrated if effective thickness is exceeded

### Composite Armor

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple layers of different materials
- Ceramics, steel, air gaps
- Much more effective than steel alone

**Behavior**:
- Harder to penetrate than equivalent steel thickness
- Can defeat HEAT shells effectively
- Found on modern MBTs

**Example**: T-72B3 has composite armor that is much more effective than its listed thickness suggests

### ERA (Explosive Reactive Armor)

**Characteristics**:
- Explosive plates on armor surface
- Detonates when hit by certain shell types
- Defeats HEAT and some kinetic rounds

**Behavior**:
- Can be "eaten" by first hit
- May detonate when hit
- Effective against shaped-charge projectiles
- May not protect against APFSDS at high angles

### Spaced Armor

**Characteristics**:
- Air gaps between armor plates
- Outer plate can cause shell to yaw or break
- Effective against HEAT

**Behavior**:
- First plate can trigger HEAT fuse early
- Can cause kinetic rounds to yaw
- Found on many modern vehicles

## Understanding Weak Spots

### Why Weak Spots Exist

All tanks have areas with less armor:
- **Design Constraints**: Can't armor everything
- **Weight Limits**: Too much armor = too heavy
- **Functional Requirements**: Hatches, viewports, etc.

### Common Weak Spot Locations

1. **Lower Front Plate**: Often thinner, more vertical
2. **Side Armor**: Usually much thinner than front
3. **Rear Armor**: Weakest armor on most tanks
4. **Turret Ring**: Gap between hull and turret
5. **Commander's Cupola**: Often weaker than turret face
6. **Roof Armor**: Very thin on most tanks
7. **Viewports/Drivers Hatch**: Weaker than surrounding armor

### How to Find Weak Spots

1. **Inspection**: Use X-Ray view in hangar to see armor values
2. **Testing**: Shoot different areas and see what penetrates
3. **Guides**: Check weak spot guides for specific vehicles
4. **Experience**: Learn through gameplay

## Practical Applications

### Protecting Yourself

**Hull Down**:
- Find positions that hide your hull
- Use terrain to your advantage
- Angle turret slightly if possible

**Angling**:
- Don't face enemies directly
- Angle 15-30° from threat direction
- Balance between protection and gun arc

**Positioning**:
- Use cover to protect weak areas
- Don't expose side armor unnecessarily
- Hide lower front plate behind cover

### Penetrating Enemies

**Aim for Weak Spots**:
- Lower front plate
- Side armor
- Turret ring
- Commander's cupola

**Use Angles**:
- Hit armor perpendicular when possible
- Avoid extreme angles (70°+)
- Consider your shell's normalization

**Shell Selection**:
- Use APFSDS for thick armor
- Use HEAT for angled armor (when not composite)
- Use HE for light vehicles or modules

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Angle Calculation

Given:
- Enemy armor: 120mm at 45° angle
- Your shell penetration: 150mm

Calculate effective armor thickness. Can your shell penetrate?

**Answer**: Effective = 120mm / cos(45°) = 120mm / 0.71 = 169mm effective. No, 150mm cannot penetrate.

### Exercise 2: Hull Down Practice

1. Find a hill or elevated position
2. Practice reversing until only turret shows
3. Engage a target from this position
4. Note how much harder you are to kill

### Exercise 3: Angling Practice

1. In a match, practice angling your tank 20-30°
2. Note enemy shells bouncing
3. Compare protection vs. facing directly

## Common Mistakes

1. **Facing enemies directly**: Always angle for better protection
2. **Exposing weak spots**: Lower front plate, sides, rear
3. **Not using hull down**: Missing opportunities for better protection
4. **Over-angling**: Angling too much exposes weaker side armor
5. **Ignoring roof armor**: Don't expose thin roof to enemies above

## Advanced Concepts

### Overmatching

When shell caliber is much larger than armor thickness:
- **Rule**: Shell caliber > 3 × Armor thickness = Overmatch
- **Effect**: Shell can ignore armor angle in many cases
- **Example**: 152mm shell vs 50mm armor = overmatch

### Shell Normalization

Some shells "normalize" on impact:
- Shell straightens out slightly on impact
- Reduces effective armor angle
- APFSDS has good normalization
- HEAT does not normalize

## What's Next?

Now that you understand armor mechanics, it's time to learn about **weak spots** in detail. Chapter 3 will teach you how to identify and exploit weak spots on every vehicle type!
