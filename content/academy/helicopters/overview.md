# Heli Academy – Rotary-Wing Warfare Doctrine

The Heli Academy is the rotary-wing arm of War Thunder’s Academy program. This doctrine manual is designed as a complete field guide for helicopter pilots joining Ground Realistic Battles (Ground RB). Every page focuses on legitimate, ToS-compliant tactics refined through experience—no gimmicks, no exploits, just disciplined flying and battlefield awareness. Read sequentially to build a full foundation, or jump to sections that match your immediate training needs.

## 1. Mission of the Heli Academy

**Purpose of the module**

The Heli Academy develops rotary-wing pilots who can anchor a team’s CAS strategy. It standardizes terminology, emphasizes survivability, and explains how each weapon system should be brought to bear within the Ground RB tempo. Graduates understand when to spawn, how to load their helis for specific missions, and how to coordinate with both air and ground teammates.

**Intended audience**

- Tankers who just unlocked their first helicopter and need a safe onboarding path.
- CAS enjoyers who want doctrine-level guidance instead of scattered tips.
- Squad leaders who coordinate multi-vehicle pushes and require a common language for briefs and debriefs.
- Veteran pilots who want a reference handbook to refine their threat priorities and training plans between patches.

**Helicopters within the Ground RB meta**

- **Force multiplier:** A single disciplined helicopter can freeze an entire enemy wing by threatening exposed armor, blocking reinforcement routes, and denying open ground to cap rushers.
- **CAS ecosystem:** Helis provide persistence and precision, offering follow-up shots long after fixed-wing attackers have RTBed or died. They complement jets by staying close to the fight without needing a runway.
- **Team support:** Helicopters extend the scouting net, relay map intelligence, and neutralize obstacles (hard camping heavies, entrenched TDs) that slow friendly armor. When used correctly, they reduce the number of gun barrels pointed at your team’s push.

**Connections to other Academy modules**

- `Ground Academy`: Understand how tank commanders interpret terrain, so your CAS arrives when their assaults crest a ridge or cross a kill zone.
- `Weapons & Systems`: Learn the qualitative performance of ATGMs, rockets, SPAAs, optics, and countermeasures. Knowing enemy SPAA missile envelopes is as important as knowing your own.
- `Meta Hub`: Track which helicopters dominate each BR band and how upcoming patches may alter their loadouts, spawn costs, or survivability.
- `Map Tactics Academy`: Cross-reference map callouts, ridge lines, and urban corridors so you can pre-plan NOE routes and pop-up points before loading into a match.

> **Pro Tip (Heli):** Study the other modules even if you only fly helicopters. Understanding how tankers and SPAA commanders think lets you anticipate their responses to your presence.

## 2. Fundamentals of Helicopter Flight in War Thunder

**Why helicopters feel different from planes**

- **Hovering:** Helicopters can remain nearly stationary but only with constant control corrections. Every extra second in hover increases exposure to tank guns, SPAAs, and fighters. Train your hands to make micro-adjustments rather than sweeping corrections.
- **Low-speed maneuvering:** Planes rely on speed and control surfaces; helis rely on rotor disk tilt and tail rotor torque. This means you can strafe sideways, back up, and pivot on the spot—but each maneuver impacts weapon stability.
- **Limited speed:** Most helicopters top out between 250–320 km/h in realistic battles. You cannot outrun missiles or fighters; terrain masking substitutes for speed. Accept that you survive by hiding, not by fleeing.
- **Energy retention:** Unlike fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters bleed speed almost instantly when you level out or climb. Be mindful when planning attack runs—enter with slightly more speed than you expect to need.

**Control fundamentals**

- **Collective (climb/descent):** Controls lift. Avoid yanking collective from 0% to 100%; spike climbs are what reveal you to radar nets. Think in 10% increments.
- **Cyclic (pitch/roll):** The “joystick” for translation. Small forward cyclic inputs build translational lift and stabilize the helicopter. Lateral cyclic allows side-slipping for peek shots without fully exposing the fuselage.
- **Yaw (tail rotor or differential thrust):** Keeps your nose on target. Pre-trim before launching ATGMs and anticipate torque shifts after firing rockets or cannons.
- **Trim & SAS options:** Many helicopters have Stability Augmentation Systems. Learn to toggle them quickly—SAS helps during hover shots but can resist aggressive evasive jinks.

**Stable hover vs translational lift**

- Hovering is inherently unstable. Use it only when shielded by terrain or when you must maintain sight picture for a missile that is seconds from impact.
- Translational lift begins once you accelerate to roughly 50–80 km/h. The rotor disk enters cleaner airflow, reducing power required to stay aloft and making cyclic inputs more predictable.
- Practice transitioning between hover, low forward speed, and medium-speed cruise without altitude spikes. Smooth transitions allow you to pop up, take a shot, and drop again without telegraphing your location.

**Nap-of-the-earth (NOE) flying**

- NOE flying is the reason helicopters can operate inside Ground RB. By matching the contour of the terrain—tree lines, ridges, riverbeds—you limit how many enemy sensors can detect you.
- When planning a NOE route, identify three things: initial cover (trees or hills near spawn), mid-route mask (a ridge or urban block), and final pop-up point. The path should allow multiple exit options in case SPAAs or fighters respond.
- Combine NOE with lateral weaving. Even small S-turns make it harder for SPAAs to lead you if they catch glimpses through the foliage.

**Environmental factors**

- **Wind & turbulence:** Some test missions include gusts that push the heli laterally. Counter gently; overcorrection leads to oscillations and exposes your profile over the treetops.
- **Lighting:** Flying with the sun behind you makes it harder for enemy tank commanders to spot your silhouette. Conversely, avoid displaying a silhouette against a bright sky when approaching from high ground.
- **Acoustics:** In Ground RB, attentive players hear rotor beats before they see you. Mask the sound by staying over friendly lines or noisy areas (urban battlefields, artillery barrages).

### Control Setup & Instruments

- **Input devices:** A HOTAS or gamepad with analog axes offers smoother collective management than a keyboard. If you remain on keyboard-mouse, bind incremental collective to mouse wheel for finer adjustments.
- **Trimming:** Bind dedicated trim controls so you can dial out pitch and roll drift mid-flight. Leaving trim unbound forces constant counter-inputs, increasing fatigue over long sorties.
- **Sight stabilization:** Many helis possess auto-hover or sight stabilization toggles. Assign them to reachable buttons and practice switching between “stable shot” mode and “aggressive escape” mode.
- **Cockpit cues:** Learn to read climb rate, radar warning receivers, and engine torque gauges. Over-torqueing in a panic climb slows rotor RPM and makes you an easy target.
- **Third-person vs gunner view:** Transition cleanly between views. Third-person helps with terrain awareness; gunner view offers magnification. Practice popping up while already in gunner view so you do not fumble perspective mid-shot.

> **Pro Tip (Heli):** Record short test flights and watch your control indicators. Noticing how often you over-correct is the fastest way to smooth your flying.

> **Warning:** If you can see the horizon under your helicopter, you are already too high for NOE. Drop altitude before adjusting anything else.

## 3. Roles of Helicopters in Ground Battles

**Long-range ATGM sniper**

- Operates 3–8 km behind the frontline, often on elevated ground or hovering just behind ridges.
- Uses thermals or stabilized optics to identify hull-down MBTs, SPAAs, and TDs.
- Requires disciplined exposure windows and a backup retreat route. Best flown when your team has already scouted SPAA positions.

**Close-range rocket striker**

- Attacks within 1–2 km, relying on momentum and terrain masking.
- Ideal against clustered mediums, cap-circle defenders, and spawn pushes.
- Demands precise timing: pop up, align sight, ripple rockets, dive. Any hesitation results in instant SPAA retaliation.

**Gunship for lightly armored targets**

- Uses autocannons, door guns, or chin turrets to sweep scouts, open-top TDs, and artillery.
- Works best once radar SPAAs are down or distracted.
- Helps your team when enemy light tanks repeatedly sneak behind lines; you can patrol rear flanks at low altitude.

**Harassment and distraction**

- Sometimes the kill is less valuable than forcing heavies to reverse and hide.
- By threatening multiple angles, you stretch enemy situational awareness and create openings for your ground teammates.

**Area denial**

- Rockets and proximity-fused munitions can deny bridges, narrow passes, or cap approaches, slowing enemy advances until reinforcements arrive.

> **Rule of thumb:** Helicopters are glass cannons. You deliver precision violence, not sustained front-line pressure. If you’re in the same grid square as your MBTs, you’re too close.

---

## 4. ATGM (Guided Missile) Warfare

### 4.1 Basics of ATGMs

- **Guidance types modeled in-game:** Most heli missiles are SACLOS, but some use beam riding or semi-active laser homing. Regardless of type, your sight line or designator must remain on target throughout flight.
- **Command lag:** There is always a fraction of a second delay between your sight adjustment and missile response. Anticipate target movement rather than reacting after it happens.
- **Minimum/maximum range:** Know the envelope. Launching at targets inside minimum range wastes ordnance and reveals your position; shooting beyond max range causes missiles to self-destruct in mid-air.

### 4.2 Engagement Flow with ATGMs

1. **Route selection:** Pick a ridge or treeline that conceals most of your fuselage. Approach at NOE height.
2. **Pre-aim:** Before you pop up, align the helicopter nose toward the expected target area to minimize yaw corrections during the shot.
3. **Exposure:** Raise collective just high enough to see over cover; do not clear the entire hull.
4. **Launch:** Fire from a hover or gentle forward drift. If the target turns, pre-lead with smooth cyclic movements.
5. **Guidance:** Keep the sight steady. Avoid zooming excessively unless you have stabilized optics; over-zooming magnifies wobble.
6. **Break:** As soon as the missile hits (or misses), drop collective, reverse behind cover, and shift laterally to a new position.

> **Pro Tip (Heli):** If two players operate jointly, have one mark targets using a scout vehicle or UAV while the heli waits behind cover. The moment a mark appears, execute the pop-up attack before the enemy relocates.

```

```

### 4.3 Common ATGM Mistakes

- **Hovering too high and too long:** Every extra second increases the probability that radar SPAAs or fighters will lock you. Pop up, fire, and drop.
- **Shooting through cover:** ATGMs detonate when they touch foliage, poles, or buildings. Confirm a clean lane before launch.
- **Ignoring SPAA presence:** SPAAs are your natural predators. If they survive your first missile, they will relocate and wait for you to peek again.
- **Overcommitting at close range:** Inside minimum arming distance, ATGMs cannot help you. Either switch to rockets/guns or break off entirely.

### 4.4 Advanced ATGM Techniques

- **Loft shots:** Some helis can elevate the missile slightly before guiding it down, allowing you to fire over tall cover. Practice in test flights to learn the pitch angles that clear obstacles without losing control.
- **Ripple firing:** High-tier helis equipped with multiple rails can launch two missiles a second apart at different targets. This overwhelms SPAAs that try to dodge the first missile and exposes their side to the second.
- **Counter-movement tracking:** When hunting moving targets, aim ahead of their path and let the missile fly through the target rather than trying to chase its tail. This is critical against light tanks and SPAAs that weave.
- **Abort discipline:** Know when to cancel a shot. If a fighter dives during your guidance, release the sight, break, and live. A failed ATGM is cheaper than losing your helicopter.

### 4.5 Target Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Target Type | Rationale | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Radar SPAA | Only enemies that can kill you anywhere on the map | Strike as soon as they fire or reveal their radar sweep |
| 2 | SPAAs without radar | Shorter range but still lethal; removing them frees your team’s CAS | Approach from outside their gun arcs if possible |
| 3 | Heavy MBTs in key positions | Breaking a hull-down heavy opens cap lanes | Coordinate with allies to capitalize immediately |
| 4 | TDs covering choke points | They often lack roof armor and are blind when tunnel-visioning | Use side angles to avoid mantlet shots |
| 5 | Light flankers | They threaten your artillery and spawn lines | Guns or rockets may be faster than ATGMs here |

### 4.6 Weather & Battlefield Conditions

- **Fog and low clouds:** Favor helis. Reduced visibility shortens SPAA engagement windows, allowing closer pop-ups. Use thermals if available, but remember that fog also hides enemy SPAAs until you are nearly on top of them.
- **Rain and storms:** Sound masking improves, but crosswinds worsen. Plan for extra lateral drift during rocket runs.
- **Night battles:** Thermal sights dominate; if you lack them, rely on tracers from friendly tanks to cue targets. Consider switching to roles that exploit illumination rounds or coordinate with teammates using spotlights.
- **Urban fighting:** GPS-style precision matters less than patience. Bounce between buildings, use streets as corridors, and fire down alleyways to flush defenders out for your MBTs.

---

## 5. Rocket & Gun Employment

### 5.1 Rockets

- **Loadout planning:** Mix HE, HEAT, or proximity rockets based on expected targets. HE floods capture points, HEAT strikes heavier armor, and proximity rounds deny air corridors.
- **Salvo management:** Many helicopters allow ripple quantity adjustments. Set small salvos (2–4 rockets) for precise work and larger salvos (8–12 rockets) for area denial.
- **Attack geometry:** Favor shallow (5–15°) dives from treetop level to minimize vertical exposure. If the terrain forces a steeper dive, start higher behind cover and descend quickly so you spend minimal time silhouetted.
- **Lead correction:** Rockets take time to travel. Aim ahead of moving tanks and offset for crosswinds (even slight ones in large maps).

**Basic rocket run**

1. Start behind cover with at least 150 km/h airspeed.
2. Fly NOE toward the target while staying inside tree cover or masking behind hills.
3. Pop up 1 km out, align the sight, and ripple rockets in a controlled burst.
4. Begin your break before the last rocket leaves the pod; never wait to confirm hits while exposed.
5. Dive back to treetop level and egress diagonally to avoid predictable straight-line exits.

> **Warning:** Never fly straight at SPAAs. They will cut you down before you release rockets. Approach from offset angles or use other targets to bait their aim elsewhere.

### 5.2 Guns & Autocannons

- **Employment criteria:** Use guns when rockets are depleted, when targets are too light for missiles to be economical, or when you must stay covert (guns are quieter than rocket salvos).
- **Aim discipline:** Bind sight stabilization to maintain a steady reticle. Fire in 1–2 second bursts to avoid overheating and to keep the nose controllable.
- **Module sniping:** Autocannons can destroy optics, barrels, or tracks. Blinding an MBT often forces it to retreat, granting breathing room for your ground line.
- **Suppression fire:** When your team pushes a choke point, orbit behind cover and rake likely enemy hull-down spots with cannon bursts to discourage them from peeking.

```

          \_/\/\/\/ \__/
              ^ Fire rockets
              | Break low, jink away
```

### 5.3 Mixed Ordnance Tactics

- Alternate rockets and guns on successive runs to stay unpredictable.
- Carrying both ATGMs and rockets lets you switch roles mid-match. For instance, use missiles to remove SPAAs, then rockets to clear a cap.
- Keep mental inventory: track how many ATGMs remain, how many rocket pods are half full, and whether your ammunition mix suits the current threats.

### 5.4 Employment Checklist

1. **Before takeoff:** Confirm ordnance mix, countermeasure quantity, and fuel load suit the intended sortie length.
2. **Ingress:** Identify at least two NOE routes and rehearse them mentally before crossing midfield.
3. **Targeting:** Prioritize SPAAs, then high-impact MBTs, then soft targets. Reassess after every kill.
4. **Egress:** Execute the break plan even if the target survives; you can re-attack after repositioning.
5. **Reset:** While masked, check ammo counts, radar warnings, and team status. Decide whether to re-engage or rotate to a new role.

> **Checklist mantra:** “Load, mask, strike, break, reset.” Repeat it until it becomes muscle memory.

## 6. Survival vs SPAA and Fighters

### 6.1 Understanding Threats

- **Non-radar SPAAs:** Examples include gun trucks and older self-propelled AA. They rely on visual spotting and tracers, giving you a small warning window. Zigzag and drop altitude the instant you see tracers.
- **Radar SPAAs:** Modern SPAAs possess search radar (detect) and tracking radar (engage). Some fire radar-guided missiles, others fire proximity-fused shells. Assume any high-tier match contains at least one radar SPAA per team.
- **Fighters:** Jet pilots will often spawn as soon as you score a kill. They may carry air-to-air missiles or simply rely on cannon passes. Many fighters patrol high altitude and dive once you expose yourself.

### 6.2 Nap-of-the-Earth (NOE) Flying

- Use map edges only when they provide terrain cover. Flying along a map border that lacks tree cover makes you an easy radar target.
- Combine NOE with pauses. Stop behind a hill, listen, scan the sky, then proceed. Continuous movement without pauses leads to fatigue and mistakes.
- Memorize safe altitude numbers: know exactly how high you can climb before clearing the tree line in your chosen map area.

```
[NOE FLIGHT DIAGRAM: heli path hugging terrain vs high-altitude line]

    High-altitude path (danger)      NOE path (preferred)
    ───────────────────────────      _/\____/\__/\____/\_
                                     Forest / ridge cover
```

### 6.3 Positioning on the Map

- **Ideal zones:** Flanks with staggered ridges, urban rooftops with multiple exit ramps, and reverse slopes behind contested caps. These areas let you peek, strike, and vanish before SPAAs adjust.
- **Dead zones:** Open plains, valley bottoms with no cover, and airspace directly above friendly spawn (fighter pilots often search there first).
- **Mobile staging:** Rather than hovering behind one ridge all match, cycle between two or three staging points. This forces SPAAs to constantly reacquire you.

### 6.4 Against Fighters

- **Visual scan:** Every time you finish a strike, climb slightly and check the sky. Spotting a fighter early lets you dive back into cover before they line up.
- **Listening:** Headphones matter. The Doppler shift of an approaching jet tells you whether it is diving or passing overhead.
- **Counterplay with AAMs:** Only attempt air-to-air shots if the fighter is unaware or tunnel visioning on your teammate. Otherwise, use your missile as a deterrent while you dive for cover.
- **Emergency maneuvers:** If a fighter begins a gun run, roll inverted and dive. Even a 50-meter descent can break their lead. Pull out low and resume NOE flight.

### 6.5 Against SPAA

- **Radar indicators:** Many helicopters receive radar warning cues. Treat any ping as proof a radar SPAA has line-of-sight. Break line-of-sight immediately.
- **Countermeasures:** Flares and chaff work best when combined with hard turns and altitude changes. Deploy as soon as you suspect a missile launch; waiting to visually confirm wastes precious time.
- **Baiting:** Sometimes a teammate in a durable MBT can bait SPAA fire. Once the SPAA reveals itself, you pop up from another angle and fire an ATGM. Coordinate on voice or pings.
- **Pattern denial:** Never repeat the same approach path two runs in a row. SPAAs track habits and will pre-trace your route.

> **Warning:** The number one cause of heli deaths is greed—staying exposed to confirm a second kill. Secure one target, retreat, and reset.

### 6.6 Signature Management & Timing

- **Thermal signature:** High engine output lights you up on thermals. Idle in cover when possible, and avoid hovering stationary over hot ground like asphalt, where thermal contrast makes you pop.
- **Rotor flash:** Against a bright sky, your rotor disc becomes a flashing beacon. Approach with a darker backdrop (mountains, forests) to minimize visual detection.
- **Timing windows:** Track enemy respawn cycles. After you eliminate a SPAA, expect it to respawn within 30–60 seconds if the player has spawn points. Use that window to strike other assets before the replacement arrives.
- **Deception:** Perform false pop-ups with no shot to bait SPAAs into firing early. Once their guns or missiles are mid-cooldown, execute the real attack from a different angle.

## 7. Spawn Logic & Match Impact

### 7.1 When to Spawn a Heli

- After securing sufficient spawn points from caps, assists, or kills. Arriving with a positive SP balance ensures you can respawn in ground vehicles if the heli dies.
- When allied scouts have marked SPAAs or when your own SPAA reports that radar contacts are down.
- When weather or lighting favors low approaches (fog, dusk, or storm maps reduce visibility).
- When your team holds at least one cap and has a stable frontline; you need friendly eyes to spot targets.

### 7.2 When NOT to Spawn a Heli

- At the opening whistle of Ground RB. You lack intel, SPAAs are fresh, and fighters spawn quickly.
- When enemy air dominance is clear (multiple fighters circling, your SPAA players already overwhelmed).
- When your lineup lacks a backup SPAA or MBT. Losing the heli would remove you from the match entirely.
- When Silver Lions are low. Helicopters carry steep repair bills, especially high-tier models.

### 7.3 Measuring Your Impact

- Keep mental tallies: high-value kills, SPAAs neutralized, caps influenced. If you notice you are not affecting the frontline, change roles or respawn in a ground vehicle.
- Note how enemy behavior shifts. If heavies stop pushing a flank after your arrival, you are buying time even if kills are few.
- Track survival time. A heli that lives eight minutes while forcing enemies to hide may contribute more than a heli that scores three kills but dies instantly.

> **Pro Tip (Heli):** When in doubt, wait. Spawning 30 seconds later—after your team marks a SPAA—can be the difference between a 30-second death and a decisive sortie.

### 7.4 Case Studies (Qualitative)

- **Successful spawn:** You cap once in an MBT, score a kill, and spot two SPAAs on the minimap. After confirming one dies to artillery, you spawn your heli, remove the second SPAA with an ATGM, and immediately clear the ridge for your team. Result: frontline pushes and caps.
- **Failed spawn:** You rush a heli at match start, fly at 200 meters, and launch rockets blindly. An unseen radar SPAA erases you within 15 seconds. Outcome: wasted spawn points and lost SL.
- **Adaptive spawn:** Mid-match, you notice enemy fighters patrolling. Instead of spawning heli, you bring SPAA, help your team clear the sky, then spawn heli once the air threat subsides. Result: safer CAS window and better team morale.

## 8. BR Progression & Heli Tech Tree Logic

### 8.1 Early Helis

- **Characteristics:** Limited payloads (rockets or light ATGMs), basic sights, slow climb rate. Often lack countermeasures.
- **Skills to master:** NOE routes, short rocket bursts, and coordinated strikes with ground units. Learn to identify SPAA muzzle flashes and retreat instantly.
- **Mistakes to avoid:** Trying to duel MBTs frontally, hovering over open fields, or spawning without a plan for SPAAs.
- **Recommended upgrades:** Prioritize flight performance modules, then rockets/ATGMs, then survivability gear. Handling improvements provide the biggest survivability boost at low tier.

### 8.2 Mid-Tier Helis

- **Characteristics:** First reliable ATGMs, better optics, stabilized sights, ballistic computers for rockets. Some gain countermeasures.
- **Skills to master:** Pop-up ATGM shots, threat prioritization, switching between weapon types mid-sortie, and cooperating with allied SPAAs.
- **Mistakes to avoid:** Climbing to high altitude to spam ATGMs. Mid-tier radar SPAAs will erase you before your second missile hits.
- **Recommended upgrades:** Missile guidance upgrades, sight stabilization, thermal imagers when available, and countermeasure pods. These directly increase hit rate and survival.

### 8.3 High-Tier Helis

- **Characteristics:** Modern ATGMs, thermals, laser designators, guided rockets, air-to-air missiles, advanced countermeasure suites.
- **Skills to master:** Multi-target engagements, timing flares/chaff, coordinating with squadmates for simultaneous attacks, and reading radar warning cues accurately.
- **Mistakes to avoid:** Overconfidence due to thermals or AAMs. Even top-tier helis die instantly if they hover above the treetops or ignore radar threats.
- **Recommended upgrades:** Upgrade countermeasures, missile guidance, and sensor suites first. Airframe and engine mods help but sensors keep you alive.

> **Warning:** High-tier helis cost significant SL per death. Fly them only when you have spawn point padding and understand the map’s SPAA lanes.

### 8.4 Economy Planning & Progression Tips

- **Silver Lion budgeting:** Track average repair cost per match. If a heli death costs more than your typical income, delay spawning until you can ensure positive value.
- **Module research order:** Prioritize survivability (countermeasures, engine upgrades) before secondary weapons. A living heli can complete multiple sorties; a heavily armed heli that dies instantly can’t.
- **Squadron vehicles and premiums:** Use them to bridge BR gaps. A premium heli often comes spaded; use it to practice high-tier gameplay before grinding tech-tree counterparts.
- **Crew skills:** Invest in pilot vitality, keen vision, and weapon maintenance. Faster reloads for door guns and improved spotting pay off over time.

---

## 9. Heli Lineup Synergy (With Ground)

- **Ground lineup first:** Tanks capture zones, generate spawn points, and scout. Structure your lineup with at least two competitive tanks plus an SPAA. The heli is the finishing tool, not the opener.
- **Homogeneous BR band:** Keep heli BR close to your ground lineup. Bringing a 11.7 heli into a 10.3 tank lineup risks facing top-tier SPAAs with under-tiered tanks.
- **Own SPAA coverage:** If you intend to fly helis regularly, bring your own SPAA to protect the team when you are on the ground. Pilots who only spawn heli without covering friendly airspace often lose team trust.
- **Example synergy sets:**
  - `MBT + backup MBT + SPAA + ATGM heli`: Classic balanced lineup. Use the first MBT for caps, switch to heli to remove problem tanks, fall back to SPAA if enemy fighters swarm.
  - `Light scout + light scout backup + heli`: Scout to earn spawn points, mark targets, then spawn heli once SPAAs are located. Use scouting equipment to feed intel to the helicopter pilot (even if it’s you respawning).
  - `Assault gun + artillery + heli`: Some nations excel at long-range artillery or TDs. Use them to suppress SPAAs while the heli positions for ATGM strikes.

> **Pro Tip (Heli):** Build lineups with an exit plan. If the heli dies, what vehicle do you spawn next? Keeping an SPAA or MBT in reserve lets you recover momentum.

**Squad-Level Coordination**

- Assign roles: one pilot handles ATGM suppression, another handles rocket strikes. Clear division prevents overlapping attacks and wasted ordnance.
- Share timing: call out “popping in five seconds” so allies can distract SPAAs or mark targets precisely when you expose yourself.
- Rotate air cover: if two heli pilots are active, alternate exposure. One engages while the other repositions, ensuring continuous pressure without giving SPAAs a clear lane on both simultaneously.
- Combine with UAVs or scout drones (if available) to maintain constant situational awareness for the helis.

## 10. Training Drills & Practice Routines (Heli)

### 10.1 Basic Flight Control Routine

> **Drill:** In test flight, maintain a hover at 20 meters AGL for 60 seconds, holding compass heading within ±5°. Transition into forward flight at 80 km/h, circle a waypoint, then return to hover without overshooting altitude. Repeat five cycles per session. Add gentle side-slips to simulate peek shots.

### 10.2 NOE & Cover Routine

> **Drill:** In a custom mission with varied terrain, fly from one corner of the map to the opposite corner without exceeding treetop height. Every 30 seconds, pop up, simulate a missile shot, and drop back. Track how often you exceed three seconds of exposure and aim to reduce that number each session.

### 10.3 ATGM Practice Routine

> **Drill:** Engage moving AI tanks from behind a ridge. Execute the full ATGM cycle—pre-align, pop, fire, guide, drop—for 10 missiles per session. Record hit percentage and time exposed. Once you maintain 80% accuracy with sub-5-second exposure windows, increase difficulty by engaging moving targets at varied ranges.

### 10.4 Rocket Attack Routine

> **Drill:** In heli PVE or custom missions, perform five consecutive rocket runs on AI columns. Focus on approach speed (150–200 km/h), salvo length, and egress angle. Time how long you remain above the treeline per run; strive for under four seconds of exposure.

### 10.5 Fighter Evasion Routine

> **Drill:** Partner with a squadmate flying a fighter in test sessions. Have them perform mock strafing runs while you practice evasive dives, jinks, and use of cover. The goal is to break their aim within two seconds of their attack initiation.

### 10.6 SPAA Awareness Routine

> **Drill:** Load a mission with AI SPAAs. Fly NOE until you intentionally trigger their attention, then practice breaking line-of-sight and re-engaging from a different angle. Learn to recognize tracer patterns and radar cues for each SPAA family.

> **Reminder:** Repetition builds muscle memory. These drills prevent panic when the match devolves into chaos.

### 10.7 Weekly Training Plan Template

- **Day 1:** Basic flight control routine (30 minutes) + NOE route rehearsal on two maps.
- **Day 2:** ATGM practice (20 missiles) + review of recorded footage to critique exposure times.
- **Day 3:** Rocket attack routine + fighter evasion drills with a squadmate.
- **Day 4:** SPAA awareness mission + study of radar SPAA profiles in `Weapons & Systems`.
- **Day 5:** Live matches focusing solely on disciplined spawn timing; log results.
- **Day 6:** Scenario scrimmage with squadmates: one plays SPAA, one plays fighter, you fly heli and practice multi-threat survival.
- **Day 7:** Rest and review. Analyze statistics, tweak control bindings, and plan next week’s focus based on weaknesses.

> **Pro Tip (Heli):** Treat heli mastery like a gym routine. Consistent, short sessions prevent skill decay better than marathon grinds.

## 11. Common Mistakes in Heli Play & Fixes

| Mistake | Why it gets you killed | Correct behavior / drill |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hovering high over open ground | Radar SPAAs and fighters acquire you immediately. | Limit exposure to short pop-ups; practice NOE routine. |
| Ignoring SPAA positions | You become the first casualty when they open fire. | Scout SPAAs first; prioritize ATGM runs on them. |
| Flying straight down the frontline | Maximizes the number of tanks with LoS to you. | Approach from flanks or behind friendly lines. |
| Launching ATGMs at targets behind cover | Missiles hit obstacles and reveal your location. | Confirm clear sight lines before firing. |
| Overextending rocket runs | Staying in sight during pull-out invites return fire. | Break low immediately, jink laterally, change heading. |
| Not listening for fighters | Jets silently queue you up for strafing runs. | Keep audio cues high, glance at sky before each pop-up. |
| Spawning heli without spawn points to spare | Losing the heli ruins your economy for the match. | Secure caps/kills first; follow spawn guidelines. |
| Using rockets at maximum range without correction | Dispersion causes misses; you remain exposed. | Close to 1–2 km, fire short bursts, adjust after impacts. |
| Not carrying countermeasures when available | You cannot defeat radar-guided missiles. | Load flares/chaff whenever the heli allows it. |
| Reusing the same attack lane | SPAAs predict your path and pre-aim. | Rotate approach angles every sortie. |
| Forgetting to bind sight stabilization | Shaky sights ruin ATGM accuracy. | Configure controls to stabilize the gunner camera. |
| Neglecting squad comms | Allies cannot mark SPAAs or request CAS. | Communicate; ask for pings before ingress. |
| Staying airborne when team is losing badly | You become an isolated, priority target. | Return to ground vehicles or SPAA to stabilize the match. |
| Firing ATGMs while moving sideways at high speed | Missile control becomes erratic, missing targets. | Enter a stable hover or gentle forward motion. |
| Ignoring repair costs | Reckless losses drain Silver Lions. | Evaluate the economic risk before each heli spawn. |
| Tunnel visioning on a single target | Other enemies maneuver to shoot you down. | Scan the battlefield after every shot; reset if threats multiply. |
| Forgetting exit routes | Panic climbing exposes you to radar nets. | Plan at least two egress paths per attack run. |
| Overloading with mixed ordnance you can’t manage | Weapon cycling delays shots and wastes opportunities. | Practice hotkey discipline; simplify loadouts until comfortable. |
| Failing to call out when low on ammo | Allies assume you still provide CAS and overextend. | Communicate “Winchester” (out of ordnance) and reposition. |

## 12. Summary & Next Modules

- **Key principles:** Helicopters thrive on surprise, terrain masking, and disciplined weapon employment. Prioritize SPAAs, never hover longer than necessary, and coordinate with ground allies for maximum effect.
- **Ideal pilot profile:** Patient, detail-oriented players who enjoy support roles, map study, and multi-tasking (flying, spotting, communicating) simultaneously.
- **Next modules:**
  - `Ground Academy` for understanding tank maneuvers you’re supporting.
  - `Weapons & Systems` for deeper dives into missile guidance, rocket types, SPAA radar modes, and countermeasure theory.
  - `Map Tactics Academy` to translate this doctrine into specific map routes, pop-up points, and fallback corridors.
  - `Meta Hub` to stay ahead of balance changes, heli BR shifts, and best-in-slot lineups.

Carry this manual into every sortie. Maintain NOE discipline, prioritize threats logically, and respect every radar ping. With practice, the Heli Academy will turn you from a fragile glass cannon into a decisive force multiplier for your team.
