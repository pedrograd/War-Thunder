# Air Tactics Academy – Energy, Guns, and CAS

Air combat in War Thunder is fundamentally about energy management. Understanding energy—how to gain it, how to use it, and how to deny it to enemies—is the key to air superiority.

## Introduction: The Energy Advantage

Many players think air combat is about turn rate or firepower. While these matter, they're secondary to energy management. A pilot with an energy advantage can dictate the engagement, choose when to fight, and escape when needed.

**Energy = Speed + Altitude**

Think of altitude as stored energy. You can convert it into speed by diving, or convert speed into altitude by climbing. Energy fighters excel at this conversion. Turnfighters excel at using their energy efficiently in close combat.

This academy teaches you to think in terms of energy. Master energy management, and you'll dominate air combat regardless of your aircraft's specific characteristics.

> **Meta Insight:** The best pilots don't just react to situations—they create energy advantages and exploit them. Understanding energy lets you control engagements instead of being controlled.

## 1. Energy vs Turnfighting

Energy is your lifeblood in air combat. It determines what maneuvers you can perform, how fast you can move, and whether you can escape or pursue.

**The Fundamental Choice**: Every engagement presents a choice: fight with energy or fight with turn rate. Understanding which approach to use—and when to switch between them—is what separates skilled pilots from average ones.

### Energy Advantage

**Energy** = Speed + Altitude. High energy means you have options. Low energy means you're vulnerable.

Think of altitude as stored energy. You can convert altitude into speed (diving), or speed into altitude (climbing). Energy fighters excel at this conversion.

**Energy Advantage** means you have more energy than your opponent. This lets you:
- Dictate the engagement
- Choose when to fight and when to disengage
- Perform maneuvers your opponent cannot
- Escape from bad situations

### Boom-and-Zoom vs Dogfighting

**Boom-and-Zoom (B&Z)**: Energy fighting. Climb high, dive on enemies, use speed to escape, climb again. Repeat. This is the energy fighter's game.

**Dogfighting**: Turnfighting. Out-turn your opponent in horizontal or vertical turns. This is the turnfighter's game.

**Example Scenario**: You're in an energy fighter (like a P-51) facing a turnfighter (like a Spitfire).

- **B&Z Approach**: Climb above them, dive down for an attack pass, use your speed to extend away, climb back up. Repeat. You never enter a turning fight where they have the advantage.
- **Dogfighting Approach** (if forced): If they force a turning fight, you're at a disadvantage. Your goal is to extend away and reset the engagement on your terms.

**When to B&Z**:
- You have an energy advantage
- Your aircraft climbs and dives well
- Enemy is lower or slower
- You want to control the engagement

**When to Dogfight**:
- You have a turn rate advantage
- Enemy is at similar energy
- You're forced into a turning fight
- Your aircraft excels at turning

Most engagements mix both. Good pilots know when to use each.

> **Warning:** Don't try to turnfight in an energy fighter, and don't try to energy fight in a turnfighter. Play to your aircraft's strengths, not against them.

## 2. Basic Maneuvers (Conceptual)

These maneuvers are tools in your toolkit. Learn when to use each.

### High Yo-Yo

A vertical maneuver to maintain energy while reducing overshoot. You pull up, then roll and dive back down. This lets you stay behind an enemy while managing your energy.

**When to use**: When you're closing too fast on an enemy, or when you need to reduce your speed while maintaining position.

**The Mechanics**: Pull up to convert speed to altitude, then roll and dive to convert altitude back to speed. This maintains your energy while adjusting closure rate.

### Low Yo-Yo

Similar to high yo-yo but inverted. You dive slightly, then pull back up. Increases closure rate and can help you get guns on target.

**When to use**: When you need to close distance faster, or when you're slightly behind an enemy.

**The Mechanics**: Dive to gain speed, then pull up to convert that speed into a better position. This increases your closure rate.

### Rope-a-Dope

Let an energy fighter exhaust themselves trying to kill you, then counter-attack when they're low on energy. Requires patience and good defensive flying.

**When to use**: When you're being pursued by a faster/higher energy opponent. Make them waste energy, then turn the tables.

**The Mechanics**: Defensive maneuvers that force the enemy to waste energy. When they're low on energy, you counter-attack.

### Extending to Reset

When a fight isn't going your way, extend away to reset. Build energy, then re-engage on your terms.

**When to use**: When you're losing a fight, when you need to build energy, when you want to disengage and re-engage later.

**The Mechanics**: Use your speed to extend away from the enemy. Build energy (speed or altitude), then re-engage when you have an advantage.

### Scissors

A series of rolling maneuvers to force an overshoot. Both aircraft try to force the other to overshoot. The one who overshoots loses.

**When to use**: When you're in a close-range turning fight and need to force an overshoot.

**The Mechanics**: Rolling scissors involve rolling and turning to force the enemy to overshoot. The first to overshoot loses the advantage.

## 3. Gunnery Fundamentals

Hitting targets is harder than it looks. These fundamentals improve your accuracy.

### Convergence

Your guns are mounted on your wings. They fire straight, but your target might be at an angle. Convergence is the distance where your bullets meet.

**Setting Convergence**: Most players set 400-600 meters. Closer convergence = better close-range accuracy. Further convergence = better long-range accuracy.

**Using Convergence**: Know your convergence distance. At that distance, aim directly at the target. Closer or further, you need to adjust.

**The Practical Application**: At your convergence distance, your bullets meet at the target. Closer than convergence, bullets spread. Further than convergence, bullets spread. Understanding this helps you aim correctly.

### Leading Targets

Bullets take time to travel. You must aim ahead of moving targets.

**Factors affecting lead**:
- Target speed
- Target angle (head-on needs less lead than crossing)
- Your speed
- Range
- Bullet velocity

**Practice**: Start with too much lead, then reduce until you find the right amount. It's better to lead too much than too little.

**The Learning Process**: Leading is learned through practice. Start with excessive lead, then reduce until you find the right amount. Every aircraft and situation is different.

### Deflection Shots

Shooting at an angle to the target's flight path. Requires significant lead and is difficult.

**High Deflection**: Target is crossing at a sharp angle. Requires lots of lead.

**Low Deflection**: Target is crossing at a shallow angle. Requires less lead.

**Practice**: Deflection shots are hard. Practice in test flights and custom battles. Start with low deflection, work up to high deflection.

**The Skill**: Deflection shooting is one of the hardest skills in air combat. It requires understanding target movement, bullet travel time, and lead angles. Master this, and you'll hit targets others miss.

### Trigger Discipline

Don't spray bullets. Fire in short bursts. This:
- Conserves ammo
- Improves accuracy
- Reduces overheating
- Makes you less visible

**Burst Length**: 1-2 seconds for most guns. Adjust based on gun type and range.

**When to Fire**: Wait for good shots. Don't waste ammo on low-probability shots.

**The Discipline**: Good pilots wait for good shots. They don't spray bullets hoping to hit. They conserve ammo and fire when they have a high probability of hitting.

## 4. CAS in Ground RB

Close Air Support (CAS) is aircraft supporting ground forces. It's powerful but risky.

### When to Spawn CAS

**Good Times**:
- Enemy has multiple tanks in the open
- Your team needs air support
- You have enough SP and a good aircraft
- Enemy SPAA is eliminated or distracted

**Bad Times**:
- Enemy has strong SPAA coverage
- You don't have enough SP for a good aircraft
- Battle is almost over
- You're not confident in your CAS skills

**The Decision**: Spawning CAS is a risk-reward decision. Good CAS can turn a battle. Bad CAS wastes spawn points. Know when to spawn and when not to.

### Safe Attack Angles

**Dive Attacks**: Come in from high angle, drop ordnance, extend away. Hard for SPAA to track.

**Low-Level Attacks**: Fly low, use terrain masking, pop up to attack. Harder to spot.

**Avoid**: Flying straight and level above the battlefield. This makes you an easy target.

**The Approach**: Always approach from an angle that makes you hard to track. Use terrain and altitude to mask your approach.

### Bomb vs Rocket vs Gun Runs

**Bombs**: High damage, area effect. Good for stationary targets or groups. Requires precision.

**Rockets**: Good for moving targets, multiple targets. Less damage than bombs but more flexible.

**Gun Runs**: Most flexible, unlimited ammo (until you run out). Good for finishing damaged targets. Requires good aim.

**Choose Based On**:
- Target type (stationary vs moving)
- Target number (single vs group)
- Your skill level
- Available ordnance

**The Selection**: Different ordnance for different situations. Learn when to use each type.

### Situational Awareness vs SPAA

**Always Assume SPAA Exists**: Even if you don't see it, assume it's there. SPAA can kill you quickly.

**Use Terrain Masking**: Fly low, use hills and buildings to block SPAA line of sight.

**Pop-Up Attacks**: Approach low, pop up to attack, dive back down. Minimizes exposure.

**Watch for Tracers**: SPAA tracers show you where threats are. Avoid those areas.

**Don't Hover**: Hovering above the objective is suicide. Always be moving, always have an escape plan.

**The Survival Rule**: SPAA is your biggest threat in Ground RB. Always assume it exists. Always have an escape plan.

## 5. Survival vs SPAA

SPAA is your biggest threat in Ground RB. Learn to survive it.

### Terrain Masking

Use terrain to block SPAA line of sight:
- Fly behind hills
- Use buildings as cover
- Stay below treetops when possible
- Use valleys and depressions

**Rule**: If SPAA can't see you, it can't kill you.

**The Technique**: Use terrain to block SPAA's view. Fly low, use hills and buildings. Stay out of sight until you're ready to attack.

### Pop-Up Attacks

The sequence:
1. Approach low, using terrain masking
2. Pop up to acquire target
3. Attack quickly
4. Dive back down immediately
5. Use terrain to escape

This minimizes your exposure time.

**The Timing**: Pop-up attacks require good timing. You need to acquire your target quickly, attack, and get back down before SPAA can track you.

### Do NOT Hover Above Objectives

Hovering makes you:
- An easy target for SPAA
- Visible to everyone
- Unable to escape quickly
- A priority target

**Always be moving**. Even when attacking, keep some speed and altitude for escape.

**The Mistake**: Many players hover above objectives trying to aim. This is suicide. Always keep moving, always have an escape plan.

### Recognizing SPAA Threats

**Watch for Tracers**: SPAA tracers are distinctive. When you see them, that area is dangerous.

**Listen for Gunfire**: SPAA makes distinctive sounds. Learn to recognize them.

**Check Minimap**: Sometimes SPAA shows on minimap. Check it before attacking.

**Assume the Worst**: If you're not sure if SPAA is present, assume it is. Plan accordingly.

**The Awareness**: Good CAS pilots are constantly aware of SPAA threats. They watch for tracers, listen for gunfire, and always assume SPAA exists.

## 6. Radar vs IR Missiles (High-Tier Air Combat)

At high tier, missiles become the primary weapon. Understanding how they work is crucial.

### Radar Missiles

**How They Work**: Guided by radar. Lock on to target, fire, missile guides itself.

**Advantages**: 
- Long range
- Fire-and-forget (some types)
- Effective at high altitude

**Disadvantages**:
- Can be countered by ECM
- Requires radar lock
- Less effective at low altitude

**How to Use**: Lock target with radar, fire when in range, maintain lock (for semi-active) or let missile guide (for active).

**How to Counter**: Use ECM, fly low (below radar horizon), use terrain masking, notch (fly perpendicular to radar).

### IR (Infrared) Missiles

**How They Work**: Heat-seeking. Lock on to target's heat signature, fire, missile guides itself.

**Advantages**:
- Fire-and-forget
- Effective at all altitudes
- Hard to detect launch

**Disadvantages**:
- Can be countered by flares
- Shorter range than radar missiles
- Less effective head-on

**How to Use**: Lock target (IR seeker), fire when in range, missile guides itself.

**How to Counter**: Use flares, break lock, use terrain masking, avoid afterburner (reduces heat signature).

### IRCCM (IR Counter-Countermeasures)

**What It Is**: Advanced IR missiles that are harder to counter with flares.

**How It Works**: Uses advanced seeker technology to distinguish between flares and aircraft.

**How to Counter**: Still use flares, but timing matters more. Break lock, use terrain, avoid afterburner.

> **Meta Insight:** At high tier, missile combat is complex. Understanding how different missile types work and how to counter them is essential for survival.

## 7. Jet Dogfight Patterns

Jet combat is different from propeller combat. Understanding jet-specific patterns is crucial.

### Energy Management in Jets

Jets have different energy characteristics than props:
- Faster speeds
- Different climb characteristics
- Different energy retention

**The Key**: Jets maintain energy differently. Learn how your specific jet manages energy.

### BVR (Beyond Visual Range) Combat

At high tier, engagements often start beyond visual range:
- Radar detection
- Missile launches at long range
- Energy management for missile defense

**The Tactics**: Use radar to detect enemies, launch missiles at range, manage energy for defense.

### WVR (Within Visual Range) Combat

When you get close, dogfighting becomes important:
- Energy management
- Turn rate vs energy
- Missile defense

**The Tactics**: Manage energy, use turn rate when appropriate, defend against missiles.
