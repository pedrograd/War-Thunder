## 2. Universal Map Reading Method

A systematic approach to analyzing any map. Use this 7-step method when you encounter a new map or want to improve your understanding of a familiar one.

### Step 1: Find Primary Lanes

**What to Look For**: Routes that connect spawns to objectives. These are where most combat occurs.

**How to Identify**:
- Trace paths from spawn points to capture points
- Look for terrain features that guide movement (roads, valleys, clear paths)
- Identify where players typically move
- Note which routes are most direct

**Why It Matters**: Primary lanes are where the main battle occurs. Controlling these lanes controls the map.

```
Example Lane Layout:

    Spawn A                    Spawn B
       |                          |
       |    [Primary Lane]        |
       |         |                |
       |    [Objective]           |
       |         |                |
       |    [Primary Lane]        |
       |                          |
```

> **Pro Tip:** Primary lanes are predictable. Players follow them. Use this predictability to set up ambushes and control positions.

### Step 2: Identify Early-Game Contest Zones

**What to Look For**: Areas where teams meet in the first 30-60 seconds. These are critical positions.

**How to Identify**:
- Points where primary lanes converge
- Elevated positions near spawns
- Areas that control multiple routes
- Positions that offer early advantages

**Why It Matters**: Controlling early-game zones gives you map control. Losing them puts you on the defensive.

> **Meta Insight:** Early-game positioning often determines match outcome. Secure these zones quickly.

### Step 3: Locate Sniper Sightlines

**What to Look For**: Long, clear lines of sight where snipers can engage from safety.

**How to Identify**:
- Elevated positions with long views
- Areas with minimal cover for enemies
- Positions that can see multiple lanes
- Hull-down opportunities with long range

**Why It Matters**: Sniper positions control large areas. Knowing where they are helps you avoid them or use them.

```
Example Sniper Sightline:

    [Sniper Position]
           |
           |  [Long Sightline]
           |         |
           |    [Engagement Zone]
           |         |
           |    [Enemy Approach]
```

> **Warning:** Sniper positions are powerful but predictable. Good players know where they are and counter them.

### Step 4: Find Hull-Down Positions

**What to Look For**: Positions where you can expose only your turret while engaging enemies.

**How to Identify**:
- Ridges and hills
- Rubble and debris
- Terrain depressions
- Destroyed vehicles
- Any cover that hides hull but allows turret engagement

**Why It Matters**: Hull-down positions are extremely powerful. They make you hard to kill while allowing you to engage.

> **Pro Tip:** Hull-down positions are often contested. Arrive early to secure them, or know how to counter them.

### Step 5: See Rotation Routes Between Lanes

**What to Look For**: Paths that allow you to move between different lanes without exposing yourself.

**How to Identify**:
- Terrain that connects lanes
- Covered routes between positions
- Paths that avoid open ground
- Routes that allow repositioning

**Why It Matters**: Rotation routes let you respond to battle flow. You can reinforce weak areas or exploit opportunities.

```
Example Rotation Route:

    [Lane A]  <--->  [Rotation Route]  <--->  [Lane B]
       |                                      |
       |                                  [Covered Path]
       |                                      |
    [Position]                            [Position]
```

> **Counterplay Tip:** Good players use rotation routes to control the map. Block these routes to limit enemy movement.

### Step 6: Predict CAS Safe Approaches

**What to Look For**: Routes aircraft can use to approach targets while avoiding SPAA.

**How to Identify**:
- Terrain that masks approach (hills, valleys)
- Routes that approach from unexpected angles
- Areas with limited SPAA coverage
- Approaches that minimize exposure time

**Why It Matters**: Understanding CAS approaches helps you position SPAA effectively and predict where aircraft will attack from.

> **Warning:** CAS approaches are often predictable. Good SPAA players position to cover these routes.

### Step 7: Predict Where Your Team Will Overextend and Die First

**What to Look For**: Positions that look good but are actually traps. Areas where teams commonly overextend.

**How to Identify**:
- Positions that are too far forward
- Areas with multiple enemy approaches
- Positions that are hard to retreat from
- Areas that look safe but aren't

**Why It Matters**: Predicting where teammates will die helps you:
- Position to support them
- Avoid making the same mistakes
- Set up counter-attacks
- Understand battle flow

> **Meta Insight:** Most players make the same mistakes. Predicting these mistakes gives you a significant advantage.

### Applying the Method

Use this 7-step method when:
- Learning a new map
- Struggling on a familiar map
- Wanting to improve your positioning
- Analyzing why you're losing on a map

**Practice**: Go through each step systematically. Take notes. Build a mental map. The more you practice, the faster you'll analyze maps.
