## Playstyle Guide

### Recommended Playstyle

The M4 Sherman excels as a **support medium tank** that uses gun depression and positioning effectively.

### Core Tactics

**1. Hull Down Positions**
- The Sherman's greatest strength is its -10° gun depression
- Find hills, elevated positions, or cover
- Hide hull behind cover, show only turret
- Engage enemies from protected position

**2. Angling**
- Angle hull 15-25° when facing enemies
- Increases effective armor thickness
- Don't over-angle or expose side armor

**3. Mobility**
- Use speed to reposition when needed
- Flank when opportunities arise
- Don't get caught in open areas

**4. Target Selection**
- Prioritize light tanks and SPAA
- Use positioning to engage heavier tanks from sides
- Avoid direct confrontations with heavy tanks

### Positioning Strategy

**Best Positions**:
- Hills overlooking capture points
- Behind sandbags or debris (hull down)
- Second line supporting heavy tanks
- Flanking routes when safe

**Avoid**:
- Open areas with no cover
- Head-on confrontations with heavy tanks
- Exposing sides to enemies
- Staying in one position too long

## Recommended Lineups

### BR 3.7 USA Lineup

**Main Vehicle**: M4 Sherman (3.7)
**Tank Destroyer**: M10 GMC (3.7)
**Backup Medium**: M4A1 (3.3)
**Light Tank**: M3 Stuart (1.3) or M24 Chaffee (3.7)

**Strategy**: Use M4 as primary, M10 for tank destroying, have backups ready

## Map-Specific Strategies

### Urban Maps (City Combat)

- Use buildings as cover
- Hull down behind debris
- Support heavier tanks
- Avoid close-range brawls with heavy tanks

### Open Maps (Long Range)

- Use gun depression from hills
- Take hull down positions
- Engage at medium ranges
- Reposition frequently

### Mixed Maps

- Adapt playstyle to area
- Use versatility advantage
- Support team as needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Exposing Side Armor**: Always angle or use cover
2. **Not Using Gun Depression**: Missing opportunities for hull down
3. **Brawling Heavy Tanks**: Avoid direct confrontations
4. **Staying Too Long**: Reposition when spotted
5. **Ignoring Weak Spots**: Always aim for vulnerable areas

## Tips for Success

1. **Always use hull down positions** when possible
2. **Angle your hull** but don't over-angle
3. **Support teammates** - don't play solo
4. **Use mobility** to control key positions
5. **Aim for weak spots** - especially lower front plate and sides
6. **Have escape routes** planned before engaging
